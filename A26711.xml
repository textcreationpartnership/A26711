            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Covenant is <hi>the hope of Sinners; The riches of Saints, the</hi> Magna Charta <hi>of the City of God.</hi> The forfeited Leaſe of eternity renewed; Gods Deed of Gift, wherein hee hath on fair conditions, granted <hi>ſinners</hi> their lives, and ſettled upon his <hi>Saints</hi> an everlaſting Inheritance.</p>
               <p>Hear, O yee forlorn Captives; who have ſold your ſelves to eternal bondage, ſpoiled your ſelves of all your glory, ſealed your ſelves up under e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting miſery; you are dead in your ſins, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before God, under wrath, under a curſe, bound over to eternal vengeance. But behold there is yet hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning this thing; the Lord
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47970:5"/>
God hath taken compaſſion upon you, hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a way for you to eſcape out of all this miſery, and bondage; Lift up the hands that hang down, comfort the trembling knees; An Ark, an Ark hath God prepared, in which is ſalvation from the Flood; A Covenant, a new Covenant hath hee made, and eſtabliſhed, which (if you lay hold on it) will recover all you have loſt, ranſome you from death, redeem you from Hell, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance you to a more ſure and bleſſed condition, than your original ſtate, from which you have fallen. This is the hope of ſinners; This is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Glorious tydings, good news indeed! but what is this Covenant? or what is there that is given and granted therein? Why, in ſumme there's all that Heaven and earth can afford; all that can bee needed, or deſired, and this by a firm and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokable Deed, made over, and made ſure to all that will ſincerely embrace it.</p>

               <p>Their

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Their Friend.</hi> I was angry, but mine anger is turned away: I was an adverſary, I had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with them, but I am reconciled, I have found a ranſome, the quarrel is compoſed, my wrath is appeaſed, I am friends with them; <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and their ſin will I remember no more; I will take away their iniquity, and receive them graciouſly; I will heal their back-ſliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from them.</hi> Jer. 31.34. Hoſ. 14.4. <hi>Glory be to God on high, on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> Fury is not now in me: favour, and friendſhip, love, and good will, is all they may henceforth expect from

me. Sinners, what is there to be feared? what is there dreadful, but an angry provoked God? Thence is ſorrow and anguiſh, thence is famine, and peſtilence, and ſword; thence is death and hell: he doth not know what the wrath of God means, that doth not ſee in the bowels of it, all the plagues above ground, and all the vengeance of eternal fire. Whatever terrors, or torments have ſeized upon thee; upon thy body, upon thy ſoul; whatever loſſes, croſſes, vexations, afflictions, plague thee on this earth; whatever horrour, and anguiſh, whatever amazing, confounding torments are like to meet thee, and feed upon thee in the lake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, thou mayeſt ſay of all this, <hi>This is the wrath of God.</hi> That day the Lord ſayes to thee, <hi>Fury is not in me;</hi> he faith alſo, <hi>Fear ſhall be no more to thee.</hi> That hour the Lord ſaith I am thy friend, Death and Hell vaniſh. The day is broken, the ſhaddows fly away. And this is one thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that promiſe <hi>[I am their God]</hi> I am their friend.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Their Portion.</hi> Fury ceaſe? Fears vaniſh? Friendſhip, favour, life granted? But what ſhall he have to live upon? Man was never intended to be a ſelf-ſufficient; he was created under a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of dependance on ſomthing without him; not onely for the <hi>continuation</hi> of his being, but of the <hi>comfort</hi> of his being: he cannot live upon the aire, though he hath ſcaped the fire: the ſoul of man is too big for all the world; like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, it can finde no reſt below, and where ſhall it finde it, or on what ſhall it ſubſiſt? Why God will not ſtarve his friends; he that hath ſaved their lives, will finde them a livelyhood; becauſe there is no other
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47970:6"/>
to be found, he himſelf will be a livelyhood to them; their portion, their maintenance, and their heritage for ever. As their deliverance is from him, ſo their dependance ſhall be on him; he is their ſubſtance, and on him is their ſubſiſtence; <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.16. he writes himſelf <hi>the portion of Jacob;</hi> and as ſuch his Saints accept him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine Inheritance;</hi> he is their bread, and their water, their ſtock, and their ſtore. The Lord [Gives] portions to his enemies; not onely the young Ravens, but the old Lions, and Tigers, the worſt of men do ſeek their meat from God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. they have their <hi>portion in this life, whoſe bellies thou fillest with thy hid treaſure:</hi> they have their portion: ſome of them have their portion in the <hi>City,</hi> others a portion in the <hi>Field:</hi> to ſome he gives a portion of <hi>gold,</hi> to others a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>worldly glory,</hi> to others a portion of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; by all theſe he deals, as the father of the prodigal, he gives them their portion, and ſends them away. But whilſt he [gives] portions to theſe, he [is] the portion of his Saints, he makes over and ſettles himſelf upon them, as their inheritance for ever: they ſhall never be in want whilſt there is in him to ſupply them; they ſhall never be in ſtraits whilſt there is in him to relieve them: all their wants be upon me.</p>
               <p>The Lord is their Portion, and he is a ſufficient portion. <hi>With thee is the fountain of life,</hi> Pſal. 36. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs,</hi> Pſal. 16. The Lord God is all things to them, enough and to ſpare: <hi>In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe there is bread enough, and to ſpare.</hi> He that hath all things below God, but not God, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; he that hath nothing beſides God, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47970:7"/>
hath God, hath all things; enough and to ſpare: filling up, and running over; there's ſtill more to be had, if more could be held: the ſoul hath never enough, till it hath more then enough; is never full till it runs over: while it can contain and meaſure and number all that it has, this is its judgement of all, <hi>Pauperis eſt numerare pecus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In God is enough for filling up and running over; enough there is in him to fill up all their <hi>faculties; their underſtandings;</hi> there are infinitely beautiful perfections, where we may gaze and glut our eyes with unſpeakable delight; but when we have looked the fartheſt into them, when the moſt ſearching eye, the moſt greedy thoughts have ſearched and run their utmoſt, they come not near the end: they ſhall look, and look, and ſee and ſee, and when they can reach no farther, then they ſhall admire at thoſe treaſures of light and beauty that are ſtill beyond them. Admiration is <hi>the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding full, and running over:</hi> when its nonpluſt, and can reach no further, then it wonders at what it perceives ſtill beyond it. The Apoſtle tells us <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18. that the Goſpel (which preſents God in fleſh) hath in it, an height, and depth, and length, and bredth; and I may tell you from him, 'tis an height without top, a depth without bottome, a length without limits, a bredth without bounds; in one word, immenſity, unmeaſurable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unſpeakable, unſearchable glory. Whilſt the blind world deride and deſpiſe the portion of the Saints, looking on God and all the things of God, as <hi>ſhallow</hi> things, that have no <hi>depth</hi> in them; they will be found by thoſe that ſearch into them, to be <hi>deep</hi> things that have no <hi>bottome</hi> in them, 1 Cor. 2.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47970:7"/>
                  <hi>the deep things of God.</hi> All the raptures, and exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of glorious joyes of the Saints in the other world, are the running over of their eyes upon their hearts, and do break in upon them from their viſion of God.</p>
               <p>There's enough to fill up their <hi>wills and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> there's infinite goodneſs, incomprehenſible love, marvellous loving kindneſs, unſpeakable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, glorious joyes, Pſal. 31.19. <hi>Oh! how great is the goodneſs which thou hast laid up for thoſe that fear thee!</hi> Oh! how great is the goodneſs! 'Tis <hi>vox admirantis,</hi> an admiring word; great beyond expreſſion, great beyond imagination; <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, neither have entred into the heart of man to conceive the things which God hath prepared for them that love him:</hi> and 'tis <hi>vox exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantis,</hi> of an heart leaping for joy, rejoycing in hope of the glory of God, which is laid up for his Saints. Laid up! where? Why laid up in himſelf; that's the fountain, that's the treaſury; there's love, there's joy, there's ſatisfaction, <hi>our life is hid with Christ in God.</hi> Oh love the Lord all ye his Saints. O bleſs the Lord all ye his Saints. He that is mighty hath done for you great things: <hi>ſince the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye ſeen, oh God beſides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him,</hi> Iſa. 64.4. or as 'tis in the margin, <hi>There hath not been heard or ſeen a God beſides thee, which doth ſo for him that waiteth for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's enough to fill up our <hi>time;</hi> there's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring work, and praiſing work <hi>for ever:</hi> there's matter for love, and joy to live, and feed upon for ever; endleſs praiſes, eternal pleaſures, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47970:8"/>
rejoycings, Iſa. 35. <hi>Everlaſting Joy,</hi> Pſal. 16. <hi>pleaſures for evermore.</hi> There's enough to <hi>reward all our labours,</hi> and repay all our expences: there's a full reward; Gen. 15.1. <hi>Fear not Abram, I am thy ſhield, and exceeding great reward.</hi> Chriſtian, thou ſhalt not ſerve the Lord for nought, he will reward thee, and 'tis little in his eyes, that thou ſhouldeſt ſerve him for corn, and for wine, for ſheep and for oxen; yea for the crowns and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world: theſe ſhall not be thine hire; the everlaſting God will be thy reward, thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great reward: exceeding, not thy work on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but thy very thoughts alſo: A little is too much for thy earnings, but the whole world is too little for his bounty: leſs than nothing might ſatisfie for thy labours, but leſs than himſelf will not ſatisfie for his love: the eternal God will be thy reward. Oh the unſearchable riches of the pooreſt of Saints! <hi>Onimium foelices,—bona ſi ſua nôrint.</hi> Poor? what and yet haſt a God! In want? what and yet haſt all things? Is he a God that is thine, and art thou ſtill in ſtraits? Would a few ſheep and oxen, vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and olive-yards, make thee a rich man, and can a God leave thee a beggar? Is not a pearl more than pebbles? Milk and wine, than mud and water? Men uſe to ſay, <hi>Money is all things:</hi> meat, and drink, and clothes, and friends, and lands; virtually all things. And is not God more than money? Sure he hath ſaid to his Gold [thou art my god] that cannot ſay, <hi>Let God be mine, and then go thou thy way.</hi> Haſt thou a God, and yet poor? Nay farther, would the fatneſs of the earth, and the fulneſs of heaven, if thou hadſt both, be enough for thee? Would corn, and wine, and houſes, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47970:8"/>
lands, and pleaſures here, and eternal life hereafter ſuffice thee? And is not God alone as much as all this? Doſt thou want Star-light when thou haſt the Sun? Is the Ocean more full for the Rivers that run into it? Or, would there be any want there, if all theſe were ſtopp'd and dry? Can they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to it, which have their riſe from it? Hath the almighty God a ſelf-ſufficiency, and hath he not enough to ſatisfie a poor worm? Is he bleſſed in himſelf, and mayeſt not thou be bleſſed in him? He that thinks any thing leſs then God will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, underſtands not a ſoul; and he that wants any thing more, underſtands not God. God alone is as much as God and all the world; and this is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord, God is their portion.</p>
               <p>If enough be not yet ſaid, look a while, and conſider whence thou art taken up into this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs: What haſt thou left? What an exchange haſt thou made? Thou wert taken with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal from the trough, with the beggar from the dunghil, yea as a brand out of the burning; there thy lot was fallen. Oh where haſt thou left the reſt of the world? Bleſſing themſelves in vanity, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves with ſhaddows, and apparitions, feeding on aſhes, warming themſelves at their painted fires, ſporting themſelves with the wind, rejoycing in a thing of nought; their crackling thorns, their glozing pleaſures, their drinkings, and dancings, and riotings, their horſes, and their dogs, and their hawks, and their harlots; making a ſhift a while to make merry with theſe, whilſt they are haſting to the pit, To that fire and brimſtone which is the portion of their cup.</p>

His fruit was ſweet unto my <hi>taſte.</hi> Dwell in the light of the Lord, and let thy ſoul be alwayes raviſhed with his love. Get out the marrow and the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that thy portion yeilds thee. Let fools learn by beholding thy face, how dim their blazes are to the brightneſs of thy day.</p>
               <p>Let thy delights in God be <hi>pure</hi> and unmixed delights. Let thy ſpirit be ſo filled with God, and ſo raiſed above carnal joyes, and the matters of them, that it be no damp upon thee to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God. Thy wine is the more ſprightful when not mixed with water: Live above in that ſerene Ayre which is not incraſſated with earthly exhalations. Sickly bodies, and ſo ſickly ſouls cannot live in too pure an Ayr. Be ſo wholly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, that ſpiritual joyes, ſpiritual delights may be ſuited to thee, and ſufficient for thee. Do not ſay I want the joy of the <hi>Vintage,</hi> and of the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest;</hi> I want the joy of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and of the <hi>Bride;</hi> I want the <hi>ſound of the Milſtones,</hi> and the <hi>light of the Candle,</hi> to make my comfort full. Let the joy of the Lord be thy ſtrength, and thy life: Say with the Prophet Habbak. 3.17,18. <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines, the labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the Fields ſhall yeild no meat, the Flock ſhall be cut
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47970:11"/>
off from the fold, and there ſhall be no Herd in the ſtalls; yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> This is the ſecond thing in Fruition, Delight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> The quiet, or reſting of the ſoul in its portion: Therefore the Schools ſay, it is onely the <hi>ultimus finis,</hi> the laſt end, that is the proper object of fruition. The carnal world, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they poſſeſs, yet they cannot be ſaid properly to enjoy it; though they be their gods that they live upon (their dragg is their god, their yarn is their god, their plough, and their plenty, and their pleaſure is their god, they burn incenſe to them) though they be their gods that they live upon, yet they cannot enjoy them; there is no reſt for them in their god, Pſal. 25.12,13. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord, his ſoul ſhall dwell at eaſe:</hi> In the Original 'tis, ſhall <hi>lodge in goodneſs.</hi> The ſoul is never in eaſe whileſt 'tis in want, every want wrings; it can never take up its lodging where it cannot take its reſt. His ſoul ſhall be at eaſe, ſhall lodge, that is, ſhall take up its reſt in the goodneſs of God: and when we finde reſt in our beds, then we enjoy them. Is thy ſoul lodg'd in God? O enjoy thy lodging: <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many years. Return to thy reſt O my ſoul, for the Lord hath dealt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with thee.</hi> As it was ſaid [to] ſo let it be ſaid [by] the Church and every Saint, <hi>This is my rest,</hi> here will I dwell for ever. Here thou mayeſt find reſt, when thou haſt no other rock to lean upon: thou mayeſt be at reſt in thy God, in thy moſt reſtleſs ſtate; in a weary land, in a barren wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in a tempeſtuous Ocean: how ever it was in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47970:11"/>
the viſion of the Prophet, yet thou mayeſt ſay, if the wind riſe, the Lord is in the wind; if after the wind an earthquake, the Lord is in the earthquake; if after the earthquake a fire, the Lord God is in the fire; and where-ever thou findeſt God, thou mayeſt find reſt. If thou findeſt God in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thou wilt find reſt in the wilderneſs; if thou find God in the earthquake, or the tempeſt, or the fire, even there alſo thy ſoul ſhall find reſt: when thou canſt not reſt in thy bed, nor in thine houſe, nor in thy land, thou mayeſt ſtill reſt in thy God. Say Chriſtian, ſay again, <hi>Return to thy reſt, oh my ſoul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with me.</hi> Though my helps fail me, and my friends fail me, and my fleſh and my heart fails me, God is the ſtrength of mine heart, and my portion for ever; this is my reſt, here will I dwell for ever.</p>
               <p>To theſe I might add a fourth thing wherein Fruition ſtands; The <hi>making uſe of our Portion.</hi> He enjoys that uſes what he hath; though the Schools diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>frui</hi> and <hi>uti:</hi> yet in a ſenſe (eſpecially with a reſpect to our preſent eſtate) the latter may be comprehended under the former. We then enjoy our portion, when we have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and heart to make uſe of it on all occaſions. I am thine, ſoul, come and make uſe of me as thou wilt: Thou mayeſt freely, I have nothing, but 'tis for thee; thou mayeſt freely come to my ſtore, and the oftner the better welcome; have thou not a God lying by thee to no purpoſe; let not thy God be as others gods, ſerving only for a ſhew: Have not a name only that thou haſt a God; ſince he allows thee, having ſuch a friend uſe him daily, my God ſhall ſupply all your wants; never want
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47970:12"/>
whileſt thou haſt a God, never fear or faint whileſt thou haſt a God; go to thy treaſure and take what-ever thou needeſt; there's bread, and clothes, and health, and life, and all that thou needeſt. O Chriſtian, learn the divine skill to make God all things, to make bread of thy God, and water, and health, and friends, and eaſe; he can ſupply thee with all theſe; or, which is better, he can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of all theſe: thy food, thy clothing, thy friend, thy life to thee. All this he hath ſaid to thee in this one word, <hi>I am thy God;</hi> and hereupon thou mayeſt ſay, <hi>I have no husband, and yet I am no widow, my maker is mine husband. I have no father nor friend, and yet I am neither fatherleſs nor friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; my God is both my father and my friend. I have no childe, but is not he better to me than ten children? I have no houſe, but yet I have an home, I have made the most high mine habitation. I am left alone, but yet I am not alone, my God is good company for me; with him I can walk, with him I can take ſweet counſel, finde ſweet repoſe; at my lying down, at my riſing up, whileſt I am in the houſe, as I walk by the way, my God is ever with me; with him I travel, I dwell, I lodge, I live, and ſhall live for ever.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Live up to your priviledge.</hi> Live according to your rank and quality, according to your riches laid up for you in God.

Chriſtians, feed not on aſhes or husks, you have better meat; you have milk and honey, marrow and fatneſs, the hidden manna, the bread that comes down from heaven, the water of life; you have bleſſed priviledges, precious promiſes, lively hopes, living comforts, glorious joyes, the fountain of life to feed your ſouls upon; come, eat, O friends; drink, yea drink abundantly, O my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; out-fare the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. who fared deliciouſly every day: you have enough to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; let every day be a gaudy day, a feaſt-day with you.</p>

ſuch dangerous attempts of this kind they meet withall, that they often are in great doubt what the iſſue may be.

               <p>But what-ever their dangers and their fears thereupon are, here's ſufficient proviſion made againſt all. God is their ſhield.</p>

               <p>But oh what meaneſt thou in this, to be ſhifting thy ſelf from danger, by ſhrinking back from thy God? ſecuring thy ſelf from affliction, by taking ſanctuary in Iniquity? What art thou doing, but throwing away thy ſhield, to ſave thee from harm? making a breach in thy wall, to keep thee in ſafety? <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, &amp;c. <hi>chap.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Walk before me, and be

               <p>Of all cryes, there are no ſuch ſtrong cries as the <hi>cry of blood,</hi> and that whether it be againſt, or for the guilty; its voice ſhall be heard on high. <hi>Thy brothers blood cryeth unto me from the ground.</hi> Gen. 4. and what followed?

Thou haſt many cries againſt thee; Sathan cries, thy ſins cry, thine own heart, thy conſcience cries againſt thee; and thou art amazed at the dreadful noiſe they make; but behold the blood of the Lamb, the blood of God cries for thee.

thee, pitiful bowels.

He is merciful, and his mercies are tender mercies; he is pittiful, and his compaſſions are tender compaſſions: thou art not ſo tender, of the wife of thy boſome, of the childe of thy bowels; thou art not ſo tender of thine own fleſh, of the apple of thine eye, of thine own ſoul, as thy Lord is of thee: His ſpirit is moved for thee, his ſoul melts over thee, he bleeds in thy wounds, he ſuffers in thy ſorrows, his eye weeps, his heart breaks over thy broken and undone ſtate; fear not his forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thee, his bowels will remember him of thee.</p>
               <p>He is a merciful and a <hi>[faithful]</hi> high Prieſt.

He is gone, but he hath carried thy name with him, as a perpetual memorial for thee. Thou art unfaithful, ſhame to thee; thou forgetteſt thy Lord at every turn; every buſineſs that comes, every trouble that comes, every pleaſure that comes, every companion that comes in, makes thee forget thy Lord; forget his love, forget thy duty; Oh how ſmall a matter will ſteal thy heart from him, yea ſtir up tumults and rebellions againſt him. Thy comforts, thy hopes, thy needs thou haſt daily of him, will not all prevail to hold him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance with thee.

unfaithful in many things, yet he is in nothing; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf;</hi> he ſhould not be true to himſelf, if he be not faithful to thee; his intereſt lies in thee; thou art his, his poſſeſſion, a member of his body, fear not; if he ſhould be unfaithful to thy ſoul, he is therein unfaithful to his own body. If thy caſe be ſuch that he can help thee, if there be any thing wherein he can ſtead thee; if all that he hath, his blood, his righteouſneſs, his intereſt with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will be ſufficient for thy help, he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to procure it for thee, and ſecure it to thee. <hi>Faithful is he that hath called you, and will do it.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Communication of Influences.</hi> [Having nouriſhment miniſtred] Chriſt our head, is our fountain of life. Our head is our heart alſo, out of it are the Iſſues of life; from him we live, and are nouriſhed and maintained in life. He is our <hi>Joſeph,</hi> all the treaſures of the holy Land are with him. <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of Wiſdome and Knowledge,</hi> Coloſſ. 2.3. <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell:</hi> Coloſſ. 1.19. He is <hi>the onely begotten Son of God, full of grace and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here note,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What grace there is in Chriſt. The Schools tell us, that in him there is a three-fold grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Gratia Unionis.</hi> The Grace of Union. The humane Nature of Chriſt, hath received the high grace or favour, to be perſonally united to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in the God-head; by vertue of which Union, the fulneſs of the Godhead is ſaid to dwell in him bodily: Bodily, that is perſonally, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially; in oppoſition to the types and ſhaddows
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47970:21"/>
of the Old Teſtament, in which God (in a figure) is ſaid to dwell. God is ſaid to dwell in the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> in the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> in the <hi>Temple;</hi> but in theſe he dwelt onely as figures, and ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the humane nature of Chriſt: In Chriſt he dwells not in a figure, but perſonally and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially. As Chriſt <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.17. is called the Body, in oppoſition to the types of old, which were but the ſhaddow; ſo bodily here notes not a figurative, but a perſonal inhabitation. Chriſt is the body, not a ſhaddow; and God dwells in him bodily, that is ſubſtantially, and not in a ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Gratia Habitualis.</hi> Habitual Grace: All thoſe moral perfections, wherein ſtands the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his nature. The love and fear of God; his humility, meekneſs, patience; in ſumme, his perfect conformity to the Image and whole Will of God. <hi>Such an high Prieſt became us, who is holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners.</hi> Heb. 7.26.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Gratia Capitis;</hi> or that honour which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him to be head of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How Chriſt is ſaid to be full of grace; there is a twofold fulneſs of grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Ex parte ipſius gratiae.</hi> In reſpect of grace it ſelf; thus he is ſaid to be full of grace, that hath all grace, and hath it in the greateſt excellency and perfection of it; that doth <hi>pertingere ad ſummum gratiae,</hi> Aquin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ex parte habentis gratiam,</hi> in reſpect of the perſon that hath it; and thus a perſon is ſaid to be full of grace, that hath as much grace as he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. Chriſt is full of grace in both reſpects; that grace which is in him is grace in the higheſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47970:21"/>
perfection of it, and as much as his veſſel can hold.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this fulneſs of Chriſt is ours, and for us; John 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs do we receive grace for grace,</hi> Coloſſ. 3.3. <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> Your life, that is both your ſpiritual life, grace; and your eternal life, glory; 1 John 5.11. <hi>This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</hi> Our life is ſaid to be in Chriſt, in three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its hid in Chriſt, as <hi>the effect in the cauſe.</hi> As the life of the branches, is hid in the root, ſo is the life of a Chriſtian in Chriſt. He is our root.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>depoſited with Chriſt;</hi> it is laid up with him, committed to his truſt and cuſtody; with him it is ſecured and put into ſafe hands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The diſpenſation of it is committed to him.</hi> from him it is at his pleaſure to be derived to us. <hi>Of his fulneſs we receive.</hi> The Son hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he giveth it to whom, when, and in what meaſure ſoever he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian, art thou nothing in thy ſelf? Thou haſt enough in thy Jeſus. Art thou dark? He's a Fountain of <hi>light?</hi> Art thou dead? He's a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>life.</hi> Art thou poor, and low; weak in knowledge, in faith, in love, in patience, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> He's a treaſure of all grace; and what he is, he is for thee. Is he wiſe? he is wiſe for thee: Is he holy? He is holy for thee: Is he meek, merciful, humble, patient? He is ſo for thee. Is he ſtrong, is he rich, is he full? 'Tis for thy ſake: as he was empty for thee, weak for thee, poor for thee; ſo for thee he is mighty, he is rich, and full. Whileſt thou bewaileſt thine own poverty and weakneſs,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47970:22"/>
Oh bleſs thy ſelf in thy Lord, in his riches, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A complication of intereſts.</hi> As the head and body, as the Husband and Wife, ſo Chriſt and his Saints are mutually concerned; are rich or poor, muſt ſtand and fall, live and die together. As the husband conveyes to the wife, a title to what he hath; as the wife <hi>holds of the husband;</hi> ſo is it betwixt Chriſt and his Church; they have nothing but through him; their whole tenure is <hi>in capite:</hi> they hold of the Head; they have nothing but through him; and whatſoever is his, is theirs: His God is their God; his Father is their Father; his blood, his bowels, his merits, his ſpirit, his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, all the ſpoils he hath gotten, all the revenue and income of his life, and death, all is theirs. For them he obey'd, ſuffered, liv'd, died, roſe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, is ſet down in glory, at the right hand of God. He obeyed as their head, died as their head, roſe, aſcended, reigneth as their head; and hath in their names, taken poſſeſſion of that inheritance, which he purchaſed for them. This is that Jeſus which is given to us, and thus is he granted and made over to all his Saints in this Covenant of God.</p>

his inheritance in the Saints. To counterwork the ſpirit of this world, whoſe work is to blinde mens eyes, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel ſhould ſhine unto them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4,5,6.</p>
               <p>This is hee by whom the Father hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. the light that the ſpitit brings in, is <hi>a marvellous light,</hi> and that in three reſpects:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>a marvellous thing that ever light ſhould come into ſuch dark ſouls.</hi> That thoſe that were born blinde, and upon whom the god of this world had for many years together been trying his skill, to thicken their darkneſs, to encreaſe and ſeal them up under it; that ever ſuch eyes ſhould bee open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the light of life ſhould ſhine in upon ſuch hearts; this is a marvellous thing. When our Lord Jeſus in the dayes of his fleſh, opened the eyes of thoſe that had been born blinde, the people ran together, and wondred at the ſight. If you ſhould ſee ſtones to live, if you ſhould ſee dead ſtocks, or dry bones to walk up and down the ſtreers; if you ſhould ſee Trees, or Houſes, or Mountains full of eyes; this were not more full of wonder, than to behold blinde ſinners receiving their ſight. Thou wert once darkneſs, art thou now light in the Lord? ſtand and wonder at thy cure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are <hi>marve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lous things,</hi> which this light diſcovers 'Tis a wonder that ſuch eyes ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee, and they ſee wonders. The Goſpel is a Myſtery full of wonders: There are heights and depths, and lengths, and breadths. <hi>Wee have ſeen ſtrange things to day.</hi> Strange love, ſtrange grace, wonderful wiſdome, wonderful pitty, patience, mercy; wonderful providences, wonderful deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47970:23"/>
incomprehenſible excellencies, unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable joy and glory; 'tis a wonder there ſhould bee ſuch things every day before our eyes, and yet wee could not ſee them till now; and 'tis a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that when wee did not ſee them before, wee ſhould ever ſee them now; that thoſe things which wee deſpiſed, derided, mocked at, ſtumbled at, as meer fooliſhneſs, and fancy, wee ſhould now ſee and admire, even to aſtoniſhment; that that Jeſus, which was to the Jews a ſtumbling block, to the Greeks fooliſhneſs, ſhould bee to the ſame men, when called, <hi>the Wiſdome of God, and the Power of God.</hi> O the deep things of God! O the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt! that hee that ſearcheth all things, reveals unto the Saints! O the hidden treaſures they now diſcover in this deep Mine! To you that beleeve hee is pretious, a Praiſe, an Honour; all Fair, all Glorious; and you have ſeen his Glory, as the Glory of the only begotten Sonne of God, full of Grace and Truth.</p>
               <p>Again, there are <hi>marvellous evils,</hi> as well as <hi>good things,</hi> that by this light are brought to light. Sin with all the hidden things of darkneſs, that lay below in thoſe chambers of death; the ſecrets of the evill heart of man. Sin appears a wonder to the ſavingly enlightened ſoul; <hi>Exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> a world of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>There's Death, and Hell, and the Devil, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſin; unkindneſs, unthankfulneſs, folly, enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rebellion, ſpite, and the blackneſs of darkneſs. What once appeared as a pleaſure, a delight, a beauty; or at leaſt, if an evill, yet but a trifle, a matter of nothing; is become a plague, a terrour,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47970:24"/>
a burthen, a bondage, bitterneſs, ſhame, ſorrow; and ſuch an high provocation, that whereas once hee ſwell'd, and murmur'd, and cryed out of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, feverity, cruelty in the leaſt puniſhment of it; now hee wonders at the clemency, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and forbearance of God; that ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and provocation, had not long ſince turned the whole earth into an Hell.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian, thou complaineſt thou canſt not ſee, thou canſt not feel, thou canſt not mourn, thou canſt not break, under all the guilt that lies upon thee; thine heart is hard, thine eyes are dry, not a tear, not a groan, ſcarce a ſigh, will all this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill fetch out from thee.

               <p>Chriſtians ſhall have enough; they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be in ſuch a needy ſtate, but whatever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them in all the earth, they ſhall have it; <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof;</hi> and he hath ſaid, <hi>That thoſe that ſeek him, ſhall not want any thing that is good,</hi> Pſal. 34.10. if the whole world can ſupply them out of all its ſtore, they ſhall be ſupply'd.</p>

providence; that which comes in from the promiſe, comes in with a bleſſing; if thou haſt but an handful, thou haſt a bleſſing in thy hand; if thou haſt but a corner, thou haſt a bleſſing in thy corner. A little from love, is a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.

               <p>O what ſerene and quiet lives, how void of care (diſtracting care) might the Saints live in the world! what are the burthens that do gall our backs? what are the briars that tear our fleſh? what are the thorns that pierce through our hearts ordinarily, but the <hi>cares of this life?</hi> what ſhall I eat? what ſhall I drink? wherewith ſhall I be clothed? where ſhall I dwell? how little have I for to day? what for to morrow? what for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after? how ſhall I ſecure what I have? when this is gone, whence ſhall I be ſupplyed? thus do we go on, piercing our ſelves through with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorrows.

               <p>Know when thou art well, and be content.

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:47970:33"/>
this is no curſe, 'tis but a croſs. Our Lord bare both the croſs and the curſe together, and that made his cup ſo bitter; but now he hath divided them; the curſe he hath left upon ſinners, and laid only the naked croſs on his Saints. The croſſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſinners, are all curſes. Every affliction is a curſe; there's wrath in all their ſufferings, there's venome upon every arrow, there's vengeance in every dart, every rod is a Serpent to them. Thou that art of the number of Chriſts implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when he comes to fall upon thee, and to grind thee under his hand, thou wouldeſt have a word of comfort to be ſpoken to thee in thy ſorrow; no, no, there's no comfort can bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; thou mayſt ſay of every dart he ſmites thee with, This is ſent of God, to revenge himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; The croſſes of the impenitent are all cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but the Saints curſes are all come to be but croſſes. Though men curſe, the Lord will not curſe; what-ever troubles come upon thee, though there be vinegar in them, yet there's no venome in them; though there be anguiſh in them, yet there's no wrath in them; though they be ill look'd, yet there's no ill will in them; they come upon no ill intent, nor ſhall have any evil iſſue. The ſmitings of the wicked are to thee, as the ſmitings of the righteous were to the Pſalmiſt, A precious balm, Pſal. 14.5. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite mee, it ſhall be a kindneſs; it ſhall be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oyl; it ſhall not break mine head.</hi> And thou mayſt ſay, Let the <hi>wicked</hi> ſmite me; ſmite me with the tongue, with the fiſt of wickedneſs, or what they will, it ſhall not break mine head, much leſs mine heart; it ſhall be a kindneſs to me, <hi>an excellent oyl.</hi>

2. <hi>The Croſs is ſanctified to its ends.</hi> It hath many holy and excellent ends, and it ſhall proſper; it ſhall accompliſh its ends. The croſs is laid on the Saint, ſometimes to prove them; ſometimes to reprove them; to humble them, to purge them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what-ever its ſent to them for, it ſhall not return in vain.

Iſa. 57.16. <hi>I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; leſt the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made.</hi> The Apoſtle tells the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. that they have <hi>need of patience;</hi> and their experience tells them, they have need of ſomething <hi>to exerciſe their patience.</hi> And their needs are different; ſome are knotty pieces and need more; others are tender, and upon them leſs will ſerve. The ſtubborn Childe muſt have more ſtripes; the ſhaking of the rod will do more on ſome ſpirits, then the ſmart of it on others; but all need ſomething. Let him onely that is without ſin, ſay, I have no need of ſhame and ſorrow. The Lord will neither over, nor under do; every one ſhall have his load and no more. No more than they can bear, and no leſs than their need requires. The Lord delights not in his childrens tears, he doth not <hi>afflict willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

nor grieve the children of men;</hi> but yet he had rather they <hi>cry</hi> then <hi>periſh.</hi> Wonder not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that your tender Lord puts you to pain, and that your pains are ſo ſharp and ſo many; <hi>Your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all theſe things.</hi> It's a mercy that he will chaſtiſe; you may put your corrections among your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. His breakings of you are his bleſſings, his woundings are your cures; and by your own, as by your Lords ſtripes you are healed. And when you ſhall review, and read over all his darker pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; and behold the wiſdome, tenderneſs, which is attempered with his ſeverities, evidenced in his laying on ſo much, and yet no more than was needful, you will then write down with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thou in very faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O my Lord, let me not want thy ſtaff nor thy rod; neither a friend nor an enemy; neither a calm nor a ſtorm; neither food nor medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; if my diſeaſe be too ſtrong for my Phyſick, let me have yet a ſtronger potion; if my wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton heart will not yet be tamed, put on more fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, an heavier load; load upon load, weight upon weight, and till thou ſeeſt, let me never ſay, it is enough. Let me never be ſick of my remedy till I be cured of my diſeaſe. Let me rather ſuffer by the hand of a Devil, than periſh by the hand of a luſt. Spare not Lord, ceaſe not Lord, to ſmite thy ſervant, till thou haſt thereby ſmitten down all mine enemies.

For as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our Conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt. And whether we be afflicted it is for your conſolation and ſalvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the ſame ſufferings which we alſo ſuffer; or whether we be comforted, it is for your conſolation and ſalvation: and our hope of you is ſtedfaſt, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as ye are partakers of the ſufferings, ſo ſhall ye be alſo of the conſolation.</hi>

               <p>The comforts of the Croſs are often the ſweeteſt and the fulleſt, that the Saints ever taſte on this ſide the crown. The firſt draught is often bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the <hi>green croſs</hi> is heavy, and 'tis neceſſary it ſhould be ſo. As 'tis with ſome medicinal waters, it works by its <hi>weight;</hi> it muſt be an heavy yoke that will tame an unruly neck; if it gall not, it will not heal; 'tis the ſmart of the rod that ſtills the Childe. Think not your burthens will lie eaſie, when firſt laid on, and think not much if they do not. The firſt conflict with temptations, may put you to an harder brunt then you are aware. It muſt be ſo that it may be for your good afterward. So my Phyſick will work, I am content it make me ſick. Tribulation worketh patience; that it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47970:35"/>
cannot do, unleſs it pains. It is obſervable, that 'tis not ſaid, the croſs worketh patience, but the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the tribulation, the pinching of the croſs, or the pain the croſs puts us to; this is patience, a quiet bearing that pain, which the fleſh when touched puts us to. When we [feel] the thorns and the nails, when the iron enters into our [ſouls] when it pricks and ſmarts, then 'twill work. The green croſs is heavy; a priſon, or a wilderneſs, will look uncouth at the firſt; but when your Lord comes in, and viſits you, then the ſweet, the pleaſure comes: and the more frowns at the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old, the more kiſſes you may expect afterwards; Chriſt doth not always meet his Saints in the Porch; the Devils Parlour, the inner priſon is his banquetting houſe; the Dungeon his Wine-cellar; there they drink and are ſatisfied. The Stocks, and the Rack, are the organs that make them the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Muſick. Many a Saint hath been ſadly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at the firſt, hoping to meet with Chriſt at the door; but behold a dreadful fight; behold ſin lieth at the door; all his ſins, all that ever he did againſt Chriſt, all his unthankfulneſs, unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unkindneſs, rebellion againſt his Lord, ſtand forth and ſtare him in the face. Chriſtians, beware of ſin now: it will meet you in the day of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, the croſs will tell you all that ever you did. <hi>I remember my faults this day;</hi> now I remember all my pleaſant things; my Sabbaths, my Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, my Liberty, the dear ſociety I once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd; but trifled and waſted away; O my pride and my wantonneſs, my idleneſs, my earthlineſs, my hypocriſie, wherefore are you come thus to affright and torment me? Lord, whether am I
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47970:36"/>
come? O how dreadful is this place? Is this my priſon-entertainment? Are theſe my priſon-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts? O what an hard lodging am I like to have with ſuch companions? O the wormwood and the gall! a dark habitation, a bitter cup indeed is now given unto me. Is this the comfort of the croſs? are theſe the ſweets ſo much talked of? Yet be not diſmayed, as roughly as thou art hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the door, 'tis better within; the Devil is going out in this ſtorm; thy ſins meet thee now, but 'tis only to ſhake hands and part; after this agony expect the Angels to come and miniſter to thee. Complain not if thou yet find no ſweet, thou haſt not drank deep enough; the next draught, the ſugar may come; in the next room thou maiſt meet thy Lord; and then tell me, if it be ſhort of all that hath been told thee.</p>
               <p>But ſhall I give you a more particular view of ſome of the ſpecial comforts of the Croſs, or our ſufferings for Chriſt! I ſhall only firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a word, to let you underſtand what I mean by the ſufferings of Chriſt. We then ſuffer <hi>for Chriſt, when we ſuffer for Chriſts Cauſe;</hi> when we ſuffer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we will be Chriſtians, we will be holy and righteous; when we ſuffer becauſe we will not ſin; and when we ſuffer <hi>upon Chriſts Call,</hi> when he cuts out a croſs for us, and lays it on. Then Chriſt calls us to ſuffering, when he puts us to this choice, <hi>Either to ſuffer or to ſin;</hi> when our backs or our conſciences muſt ſuffer; when we muſt ſuffer, or he muſt ſuffer by us. <hi>If any man will be my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple, let him take up [his] croſs.</hi> Chriſt is not, and Chriſtians muſt not be prodigal of their blood; their blood is his; their eſtates, their names,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47970:36"/>
their liberties, are all his, and to him they muſt be accountable how they part with them. 'Tis not every croſs that thou canſt call [thy] croſs; we muſt not leave our way to ſeek a croſs; when Chriſt hath laid a croſs athwart a Chriſtians way that he ſhould go; and he muſt either make a ſtand, or turn aſide, or ſubmit his neck to it; Then he ſays, There is [thy] croſs, take it up and get thee on. Whatever croſs be before thee, if thou haſt a way open to avoid it without ſin, that's none of thy croſs, thou maiſt not take it up; or if thou doſt, thou wilt have no thanks for thy pains.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians ſhould be wary here. Though it be an argument of a gracious ſpirit, to be alwayes of a ready and forward mind to ſuffer for Chriſt; and when he demands, <hi>Who will go with me? Who will bear my croſs?</hi> chearfully to anſwer, <hi>I will go Lord,</hi> let me bear it; yet ſhould we take heed, that as we hang not back, when he ſays, Go, ſo that we run not before he ſend us. Though it be an high honour to ſuffer for the Goſpel, <hi>yet no man taketh this honour upon himſelf, but he that is called of God.</hi> I would not go to a Priſon without a <hi>Mittimus</hi> from heaven, leſt if my ſuffering be of my ſelf, I be there left to ſhift for my ſelf. If Chriſt ſhould meet me in priſon or in baniſhment, and demand of me, <hi>What doſt thou here</hi> Elijah? <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> What ſhould I ſay, if I could not ſay this, Thou Lord, haſt brought me hither; my conſcience, my duty hath brought me in.</p>
               <p>But underſtand me here with this caution; That when the Cauſe for the main is Chriſts, but the Call ſeems doubtful, yet when the ſufferer hath
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47970:37"/>
carefully enquired the mind of God, truly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the dictates of conſcience, ſincerely deſigns the honour of Chriſt and his Goſpel, although he ſhould erre in ſome circumſtances of his caſe, and for fear of iniquity ſhould chuſe affliction, when poſſibly he might have avoided both; God will ſurely wink at his miſtakes, own his ſufferings, and greatly accept and reward his readineſs of mind.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill take heed of careleſs or wilful errors: take heed of preparing nails for thy own croſs; thorns, ſcourges, ſpears, for thine own head or heart. Take heed both how thou ſhunneſt, and how thou eſpouſeſt a ſuffering ſtate.</p>
               <p>Go not in upon heedleſs miſtakes; go not in for good company, much leſs upon any carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; let not thy pride, or oſtentacion, or the byaſs of any fleſhly reſpects lead thee into the houſe of correction, leſt thou find them the rods to laſh thee when thou art there.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians conſider, if there be not ſometimes ſome uncomfortable miſcarriages in this matter; and whether it hath not been the lot of ſome of Chriſts (with how much juſtice or charity, let the Lord be Judge) to bee cenſured and reproached for unfaithful or for fearful, upon no other account but for walking by this rule, <hi>not to go to Priſon without a warrant,</hi> that is, not to caſt themſelves into a ſuffering ſtate, whilſt God hath left a way open to eſcape, without ſin. I confeſs the more dangerous, and the more ordinary errour is on the other hand; we are more apt (eſpecially when afflictions are more ſharp and bite in earneſt, and then will be the great trial) rather ſinfully to ſhift our ſelves of them, than unwarrantably to

run our ſelves upon them; but yet let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether there be not an errour on this hand alſo.</p>
               <p>Its true where the cauſe is the ſame as to the main, different circumſtances may make that to be one mans ſin, which is another mans duty; yea, that may be a duty to the ſame man at one time, which (ſuppoſing him in differing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) might have been his ſin at another. And it is not ſeldome (through the unavoidable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of our apprehenſions, and the difficultie of diſcerning our caſes) that Chriſtians equally careful to know and do the Will of God, when the caſe, and the circumſtances alſo are moſtly the ſame, do judge differently about their Call to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. Here let no man be ſo tyrannical to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to expect that they ſhould go croſs to their own, to comply with their brethrens, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and conſciences. Let us not put one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on this unmerciful neceſſity, either to break our peace with God, or our Friends. Let it be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to us, faithfully to follow our own light, without judging or quarrelling with thoſe that are otherwiſe minded. Beware of bitterneſs. Be not cruel to conſciences; ſmite not with the tongue, nor let an evil thought ariſe in thine heart, upon any ſuch account as this. Thine arrows will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyl, and fly back in thine own face. Blemiſh not thine own ſufferings by blaſting thy Brothers liberty. Let not the warineſs of ſome be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for <hi>cowardiſe,</hi> nor the forwardneſs of others for pride or hypocriſie; but let us bee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with humility, let us put on a ſpirit of ſelf-ſuſpition, and charity to our Brethren; and let
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47970:38"/>
this Chriſtian frame be the more ſtudiouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by how much the more our differing pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices according to the variety of our apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeem to condemn each other, and ſo provoke to uncomfortable ſchiſms and contentions, and by how much the more pernicious ſuch ſchiſms are like to prove in the iſſue.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, I ſhall now ſhew you what the ſpecial comforts of the croſs are. You may expect your ſuffering ſtate to be ſweetned with</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A more plentiful diffuſion of ſpecial Grace.</hi> Grace is a comfort; 'tis never better with the Saints; then when that flouriſhes. The joy of the harveſt is howling to the joy of grace; he is not a Chriſtian, that cannot ſay, 'tis Summer, when theſe flowers appear in their beauty. Flouriſhing Faith and Love, have their glorious joys, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. The Springs of grace, are a reſurrection from the dead; and there's no ſuch ſpring as after a ſhower. Oh how green do the herbs then look; the withering flowers do then lift up the head; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many ſtars appear, nor with ſuch luſtre, as in a froſty night; grind the ſpices, and their fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy flows out. Saints are never more Saints, than in the houſe of bondage, or the Land of their pilgrimage; our Winter-weather makes us warm at heart. <hi>As our outward man periſhes, our inward man is renewed day by day,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.16. Perſecution is the time of life. <hi>We are delivered to death for Jeſus ſake, that the life alſo of Jeſus might be manifeſt in our mortal fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.11. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed ſoul, comfort thine heart, the croſs comes,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47970:38"/>
now thou ſhalt live; now thou ſhalt recover. This weakneſs will ſtrengthen the things that remain, and are ready to die. Now faith, and love, and patience, and courage that have ſo long hung the wing, now lift up the head; the day of your redemption draweth nigh; this <hi>night</hi> is your <hi>day</hi> of hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A more clear revelation of ſpecial Love.</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thou me Lord? there's enough. Let me hear thy voice, let me ſee thy face.</p>
               <p>Kiſs me with the kiſſes of thy mouth. Thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs is better than life; ſend forth thy light, and thy truth, let theſe tell me, thou loveſt me. Thy love-ſick Spouſe is ſick for love; O when wilt thou ſay, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I love thee?</hi> Why come up with me on the croſs; that withered tree bears more bloſſomes of love, than all the green trees of the field. The whole Goſpel is hung upon the croſs. Where our Lord hung, there's ſin nail'd, the curſe vacated, death vanquiſhed; pardon, peace, joy, glory, ſhewed forth in open ſight. There's love with all its to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, go up and take. Fear not to be baptized with thy Lords Baptiſm, nor to drink of his cup; this cup alſo is the communion of the blood of Chriſt. Come with me into the wilderneſs, there will I ſpeak comfortably to thee. When thou moſt wanteſt it, where thou wilt moſt value it, there will I ſhew thee my loves.</p>
               <p>Our Lord loves not to have love ſlighted; the full ſoul loathes the honey-comb; thou haſt yet too many Lovers to bid thy Lord welcome; he keeps his beſt Wine till all thine own be ſowred; then it will reliſh, and then thou ſhalt have it. His
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47970:39"/>
oyl is for thy wounds. The Childe never knows ſo much of the Parents heart, and bowels, as when 'tis ſick, or in diſtreſs; then every look is love; every word is pity and compaſſion. O the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſts bowels towards his ſwooning chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; when thou knoweſt hatred, then look to know love. When thou art perſecuted, when thou art caſt out, and trodden under foot of men, then will he take thee in, and cheriſh thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A more full manifeſtation of glory,</hi> There's not <hi>a priſon</hi> into which the Saints are caſt, but hath a window into the <hi>palace. Calvary</hi> becomes a <hi>Tabor,</hi> where they have a ſight of their Lord in his glory. <hi>Golgotha</hi> becomes a <hi>Piſgah,</hi> where they may look over <hi>Jordan</hi> into the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Haſt thou known little of heaven? thou haſt not yet been in the deep.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Stephen</hi> the firſt Goſpel-Martyr its ſaid Acts 7.55. <hi>He looked up ſtedfaſtly into heaven, and ſaw the glory of God, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God.</hi> And Chap. 6.15. <hi>All that ſate in the Council, ſaw his face, as the face of an Angel.</hi> Such an admirable ſplendor and ſerenity in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as ſpake him rather an Angel then a man. O what an heaven was there within, that caſt out ſuch a divine luſtre on his face. His joy was too big for his heart, his face muſt have its ſhare; yea, his very adverſaries, at ſecond hand, beheld the glory of God.</p>
               <p>He looked up and ſaw heaven opened. Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, he might ſee hell opened, all his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors about him; the jaws of death ready to devour and ſwallow him up; but looking up, he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47970:39"/>
ſaw heaven opened, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God. O there he is, for whoſe ſake is all this. My beloved, my beloved is yonder. Behold the region of light, whither this dark tempeſt is waſting me; his hell and his heaven meets, but the light ſwallows up the dark. Hell ceaſes to be hell, where heaven appears to bee heaven. This is the portion of ſuffering Saints. When you read what's written of thoſe armies of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs that have gone before; of their unſpeakable joys, their undaunted courage, their admirable boldneſs; of their chearing their friends, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding their foes; their rejoycing in their ſtripes, ſinging in their ſtocks, leaping in their chains, boaſting of their bonds, kiſſing their ſtakes, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the flames, riding up in triumph in their chariots of fire, not repenting of their Faith, nor accepting of deliverance; what doth this ſpeak, but that their eyes, as well as their anchor, are within the vail, whither Chriſt their fore-runner is gone before them. Oh who would not be with them? who would fear ſufferings?</p>
               <p>Soul, what art afraid of? whither art thou run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? from what art thou hiding thy ſelf? what is thine eaſe, or thy liberty, or thy quiet? why ſo loth to looſe from this ſhore? lanch forth into the deep. Fear not tranſportation into thine houſe of bondage; when thou art once there, 'tis but look up, and thou art in Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Such are the ſufferings of Chriſt, This is the croſs of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In ſumme; as that which comprehends all the reſt, <hi>a more manifest exhibition of Chriſts ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preſence,</hi> Jer. 30.11. <hi>I am with thee to ſave

thee,</hi> Iſa. 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> Through fire and water thou muſt go; <hi>we went through fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a wealthy place;</hi> but whither ever thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, he will go with thee. When the buſh was on fire, the Lord was in the buſh; when the three children were in the furnace, the Son of God was there with them. Iſa. 63.9. <hi>In all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions he was afflicted, he ſaved them by the Angel of his preſence; in his love, and his pity he redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the dayes of old. Though all men forſook me, the Lord ſtood with me, and ſtrengthened me,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.16,17. The Saints ſhall never have this to charge upon the Lord, <hi>I was in priſon, and thou viſitedſt me not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is ever with them; to bear their burthens, and eaſe their ſhoulders; to plead their cauſe, and maintain their innocence; to waſh their ſtripes, to wipe off their tears, to heal their wounds, to bind up their broken bones, to revive their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirits; to perfume their priſons, to lighten their dungeons, to lead them in their wandrings, to converſe with them in their ſolitudes; to give down from above, <hi>in divine ſmiles, in illapſes of ſpiritual joys, aſſurances of deareſt love, tendereſt care, melting ſympathie, gracious acceptance,</hi> to give down from above what-ever is wanting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.

               <p>Tell me, O thou whom my ſoul loveth, where thou feedeſt, and cauſeſt thy flocks to reſt at noon.

               <p>O where ever my Lord is, there let my lot fall. Let me dwell amongſt the thorns, ſo my dwelling be with my Lord amongſt the lillies.

               <p>Fainting Chriſtian, lift up thine eyes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thine heart; here's that thou feareſt and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteſt thy ſelf withall.

Thou ſtill ſayeſt, woe is me I can find no ſuch thing; <hi>Ah, Lord God, doth he not ſpeak parables?</hi> O that I were aſſured it might be thus with me; why, art thou in Covenant? believe, and all is thine. I believe, and therefore have I ſpoken; believe, and thou ſhalt ſee the ſalvation of God; as ſure as the croſs is thine, all the comforts of the croſs are ſetled upon thee. Read over all the gracious words thou haſt before thine eyes; view over all the inſtances of ſuffering Saints that have gone before thee, on whom theſe good words have been made good; in conſpicuous increaſes of divine grace, in the ſignal diſcoveries of divine love, in the cleareſt and fulleſt revelation of divine glory, in the intimate ſenſe of the divine preſence; quickning, enlarging, encouraging, ſupporting their ſpirits, in the darkeſt dens, in the ſharpeſt conflicts, with reproaches, mockings, bonds, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, torments, and deaths; and know that all theſe things are written for thy learning, that thou through patience and comfort of the Scriptures maiſt have hope.</p>

               <p>John 12.31. <hi>Now is the judgment of this world, now ſhall the prince of this world be caſt out.</hi>

               <p>Caſt out, whence? why caſt out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, out of his hold, caſt down from his throne and dominion. His priſon is broken, and now the prey is taken from the ſtrong, the captives of the mighty are taken away.</p>
               <p>But how was this now done, at the death of Chriſt, to which theſe words referre? Doth not Sathan ſtill reign? Is hee not ſtill the god of this world, and the prince of the power of the air? Yea, what hold hath hee yet of the Saints that are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47970:44"/>
in the earth? what a tyrant is hee to them? how doth hee entangle and enſnare them? what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock doth hee make in their conſciences? lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over them, leading them captive by luſts and temptations; what a ſtrong party hath he ſtill within them, bearing arms againſt their Lord, fighting againſt their ſouls? what ſad ſpoil doth he make upon their grace, upon their peace? they cannot reſt for him day nor night, abroad nor at home, alone nor in company; hee's ever follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; whither ever they go, the Devil is at their backs; they cannot pray, nor read, nor ſpend a thought, nor caſt a look, nor diſpatch a ſigh towards the Lord, but Sathan ſtands by to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and hinder them; what a yoke hath he ſtill upon their necks! what clogs and weights hath he ſtill upon their loins? how do they mourn in their ſouls, whileſt he vexes them from day to day? how do they groan, and travel in pain, ſighing in themſelves, and waiting for their redemption? How is it then ſaid, <hi>now is hee caſt out?</hi> why now hee hath received his judgment; <hi>the prince of this world is judged,</hi> Joh. 16. Now is the fatal blow given; now is the ſerpents head broken, though hee ſtill may bruiſe, and hang in the Saints heel. The blow he levelled at our Lord, hath rebounded on his own head. Though hee be as <hi>Gad, a ſerpent in the way,</hi> yet you may now <hi>tread upon this ſerpent,</hi> and it ſhall not hurt you. The ſtrong man is now bound, if hee be a god ſtill, hee's a God in chains, a prince in fetters; he muſt ask leave of your father, ere he can touch one hair of your heads. Hee cannot tempt you, nor caſt a bank againſt you, nor ſhoot an arrow at

you, without a commiſſion from heaven. <hi>The devils are ſubject to you.</hi> He is caſt out, and in your Lords name, you may caſt him out. <hi>In my name ſhall ye caſt out devils;</hi> out of poſſeſſed bodies, out of poſſeſſed ſouls; you may be inſtruments to bring many a ſoul to repentance; <hi>that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves out of the ſnares of the devil, who are held captive by him at his will.</hi> Every ſinner that is converted by you, you have caſt out a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil out of that ſoul.</p>

               <p>Nay more, hee is not only a conquer'd ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but made <hi>your ſervant.</hi> This viper ſhall yield you medicine againſt his own poyſon. His ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſhall be an excellent oyl; his meſſengers he ſends to buffet you, his thorns he ſticks in your fleſh, ſhall be a prevention of greater evils. The very deſtruction he intends to bring upon you, ſhall promote your ſalvation, 1 Cor. 5.5. <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch an one to Sathan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Behold the devil is the Churches ſervant; and ſuch a ſervant as in their preſent ſtate, they cannot well want. <hi>The executioner of their cenſures.</hi> A Common-wealth may as well want a Jaylour or an Hang-man, as the Church a Devil. Behold Sathan divided againſt Sathan; the devil without, againſt the devil within; the deſtroyer of ſouls, become the deſtroyer of ſin. <hi>Deliver ſuch an one to Sathan [for the deſtruction of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47970:45"/>
the fleſh.]</hi> Though much againſt his mind, his hand is againſt his own party. Hee's made to kill his own friends, which otherwiſe would kill the ſoul. Whether he will or no, the very tormentour is made a ſaviour; <hi>that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Chriſtians as much as you feel of the devils malice, you could ill want his ſervice; there's many a ſoul loſt and undone by a <hi>ſleeping,</hi> that might have been recovered and rouzed by a raging devil. His winds ſhall blow off your chaff, his floods ſhall waſh away your filth, his earth-quakes ſhall open your priſon-doors, his tempeſts ſhall drive you to harbour. Some men want a tempeſt, to ſave them from a wrack.</p>
               <p>Nay once more; he is not low enough yet; he ſhall be yet brought lower. You have aſſurance of his <hi>total</hi> and <hi>final</hi> overthrow. Rom. 16.20. <hi>The god of peace ſhall tread Sathan under your feet ſhortly,</hi> Rev. 20.10. <hi>The devil ſhall be cast into the lake of fire and brimſtone:</hi> 'Tis but a little while, and when he hath done his work, he ſhall be ſent to his place, where he ſhall be ſhut up, and a ſeal ſet upon him; whence he ſhall come out no more for ever. He ſhall tempt no more; vex no more, deceive no more, deſtroy no more, torment you no more; he ſhall be thruſt out, he ſhall be chain'd up; the tormentour ſhall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, day and night for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Stand Chriſtians, ſtand your ground a little while; follow your work, hold up your holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, hold on your holy courſe; keep your hearts, keep your garments, keep on your armour, keep under corruption, reſiſt temptation, bear your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47970:46"/>
hold out faith and patience, fight againſt your adverſaries, watch with your Lord, <hi>this one hour,</hi> and behold hee that ſhall come, will come; he cometh quickly, and hee that is in the world, ſhall bee conſumed with the breath of his mouth, and deſtroyed with the brightneſs of his appearing. Hee ſhall bee caſt out, hee ſhall bee caſt down, and riſe no more for ever.</p>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>GOd hath put Death into the Covenant,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21. <hi>Whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the World, or Life, or DEATH, all are yours.</hi> Death, there is a great purchaſe you'l ſay; what advantage is that? yes, death is advantage: <hi>To dye is gain;</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Commiſſion of Death is changed.</hi> 'Twas once, <hi>take him Jaylour;</hi> away with him, carry him down, to Priſon with him, there to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the Judgement, of the great day; It is now, <hi>take him Janitour;</hi> take him Porter; take him in, give him an entrance into his Maſter's joy: Death doth but take the Bride when ſhee is ready, and lodges her in the Chamber of the Bride-groom; this made death the Apoſtles <hi>deſire,</hi> Philip. 1.23. <hi>I deſire to depart, and to bee with Chriſt, which is far better.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47970:46"/>
is conquered to you, a conquered enemy, is made a Tributary, death is diſ-armed; it hath loſt its ſting; when a Serpent hath loſt its ſting, you may take it into your boſome.</p>
               <p>Hee that can ſay: <hi>Death where is thy ſting?</hi> may go on, and add, <hi>Thankes bee to God, which hath given me the victory.</hi> A Signet ſent from Heaven, with <hi>a Death's head,</hi> is a precious token; Come Chriſtians, bee of good courage, ſet your feet on the neck of this King of terrours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Death is at once, <hi>The deſtruction of all their enemies,</hi> when once death hath done its office upon them, then farewel <hi>Edom,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt;</hi> fare-well the prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bryer, and the grieving thorne; then farewel ſin and ſorrow for ever; the <hi>Egyptians</hi> they have ſeen, and fear'd, and felt, to day, they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee again for ever. It <hi>deſtroys it ſelf,</hi> their laſt enemy by deſtroying them, it hath its <hi>welcome,</hi> and <hi>farewell</hi> the ſame moment; it is but welcome death and farewel death for ever. Death dies with them; once dead, they dye no more for ever; mortality is ſwallowed up of life, <hi>death is caſt into the lake of fire;</hi> that is its Region; there, there they die, and dye, and dye again; over, and over, for ever, and ever; but for the Saints it doth but ſet them on the banks of that good Land, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it cannot follow them; our Lord by death [by ours as well as his own] hath <hi>delivered thoſe who for fear of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi>

               <p>LAſtly, God hath put into the Covenant all the means of ſalvation. And all things on their parts neceſſary, to the obtaining the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdome.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>I will account you,</hi> and reckon you for mine. You ſhall have the priviledge and the bleſſing of my people.

               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:47970:48"/>
I will mark you out for the people of my love; of you will I take care, for you will I provide, with you are my delights, over you will I rejoyce, with you will I dwell, and you ſhall dwell with me for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p>This new heart (I take it) is the <hi>genus</hi> of all
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47970:49"/>
the following graces; and therefore the leſs ſhall ſuffice, to be ſpoken of it here. A new heart, that is, not <hi>phyſically</hi> new in regard of ſubſtance, but <hi>morally</hi> onely, in regard of qualities.</p>
               <p>This new heart ſignifies both <hi>another</hi> heart, and a more <hi>excellent</hi> heart. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Caleb,</hi> Numb. 14.24. that he had another heart. And this other heart is declared to be a more excellent heart, than was in the reſt of the people. Whileſt they, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followed not the Lord, or but haltingly, hee followed the Lord fully, Prov. 17.27. <hi>A man of underſtanding is of an excellent ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another heart, that is not a new heart; <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> had another, but no new heart; the heart of a beaſt, for the heart of a man; an evil heart grown worſe, is not a new heart, but the old heart grown older.</p>
               <p>We read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9. that when <hi>Saul</hi> was anointed King, God gave [him] another heart; this was a more excellent heart, than he had before, and yet not the heart here promiſed. He gave to him another heart, that is, the <hi>ſpirit of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> the heart of a King, for the heart of a private perſon; a more publick, raiſed, heroick heart; the heart of a King, fitted to the ſtation and office of a King.</p>
               <p>The excellencies of this new heart are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but ſpiritual excellencies, as will appear more in the handling of the particular graces pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; and are ſuch as fit them for their new

1. For their <hi>new ſtate;</hi> Chriſtians are made the children of God, veſſels of honour, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people; and God gives them an heart, anſwering the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their high calling.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For their new <hi>Work;</hi> a Chriſtian hath other work to do, than other men; whileſt their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lies all here below, in this earth; in their fields, and vineyards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſtians work lies <hi>above,</hi> with their God, and their Jeſus; and <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> about their nobler, and immortal part; their work is ſpiritual, and ſuch is the heart that's given to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For their new <hi>reward.</hi> God intends better things to them; a better portion; a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hope, better comforts, joyes, delights here; and a better inheritance hereafter; and he prepares them better hearts, to receive theſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things; he will not put his new wine into old bottles.</p>
               <p>The excellencies of this new heart may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A new light;</hi> diſcovering the dignity of their ſtate, the ſpirituality of their work, the glorie of their reward.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A new law,</hi> or frame, or bent of ſpirit; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining; diſpoſing, and fitting them to all that which they are made for. And this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods writing his Law in the heart. The Law written in the heart, ſignifies, not only the Law made known in the heart, but the heart made ſuitable to the Law; and adapted to the obedience of it. There is a kind of connaturalneſs betwixt the new heart, and all that the Law requires.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:47970:50"/>
3. A <hi>new power,</hi> enabling them for their new work. We have all theſe mentioned in one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. God hath not given us a <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a ſound mind.</hi> [A ſound mind] there's the new light; [a ſpirit of love] there's the new law, or frame; and with theſe, [a ſpirit of power.]</p>
               <p>In ſumme, this new heart is the divine nature; the image of God renewed; the life of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, Chriſt formed in them. An heart after Gods own heart, containing in it all thoſe graces of the Spirit, wherein ſtands their likeneſs to God, and their capacity of ſerving, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him. This is the heart the Lord will give. <hi>A new heart will I give unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt all thoſe glorious things promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it would be objected; A kingdome promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? glory, and honour, and everlaſting bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, granted! Alas, what's all this to me? to whom is it promiſed? or upon what terms? when I conſider what is <hi>required,</hi> 'tis all one to me, as if there had been nothing <hi>promiſed.</hi> The way to this bleſſedneſs is too narrow, the gate is too ſtrait for me ever to hope to enter. What-ever the Price be, the ſtrictneſs, and ſeverities of a Chriſtian courſe, the very fore-ſight of them does amaze, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found me. Live a new life? deny my ſelf? take up my croſs? follow Chriſt? ſpend my daies in faſting, and praying, and mourning? live by rule? look to every ſtep, to every word, to every thought? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe things are againſt me. A new life? a new courſe? if this be it, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bear it. No man having taſted of the <hi>old,</hi> will endure this new way; for he ſaith, <hi>the old is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47970:50"/>
better.</hi> 'Tis all one to me, as if there had been no Chriſt, no Goſpel, no Kingdome promiſed, if it cannot be obtained upon other terms than theſe. I were even as good ſit down as I am, and run the venture of what follows, as to feed my ſelf with hopes, of that which I ſee, I can never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. If I do but move heaven-wards, the ſtream carries me down; If I do but take up a thought, make an eſſay, ſet a foot forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this new courſe, I find mine old things hang in my heels. My old cuſtomes, my old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, mine old pleaſures, and eaſe, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, quickly pull mee back. Oh what ſhall I do? I muſt bee undone, I muſt bee a loſt and damned wretch. Fain I would be happy, but I cannot be holy. I dread, I often tremble to think of loſing Chriſt, and the bleſſings of his Goſpel; but this wretched heart is too hard for me, and will not come on towards it. I am aſhamed, I am plagued to think, what I am like to loſe, and for how little; but I cannot help it; the way is ſuch, that this fooliſh heart will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it.</p>
               <p>Why hearken ſoul: The Lord that hath called thee to this new courſe, will give thee a new heart. And there is not any thing required in an holy life ſo irkſome, and ſo contrary to thee; but this new heart is ſo fitted, and ſuited to it, that it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come eaſie to thee. Its pain will bee pleaſant, its ſeverity will be liberty, its very drudgery (as thou counteſt it) will be a great delight. Pſal. 40.8. <hi>I delight to do thy will, O God, thy Law is within mine heart.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1,2. of the renewed ſoul its ſaid, <hi>his delight is in the Law of the Lord.</hi> In the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47970:51"/>
original, <hi>his will,</hi> his heart, is in the law. The law is in his heart, and his heart is in the law. Gods will and his are the ſame. What-ever God bids him do, his heart bids him do; and his hand will never ſay his heart nay. He that delights in the law, and as 'tis a law, commanding ſuch things, will never grudge to do what it commands. Where tis a pleaſure to be commanded, tis no pain to obey. What-ever work the law cuts him out, 'tis work he loves. Bid him pray, bid him watch, bid him walk humbly with his God; 'tis work he loves; 'tis in his heart to do it. Bid a Saint draw nigh to God in any duty; 'tis as if you bid the hungry to eat, or the thirſty to drink, the naked to be cloathed, the beggar to come for an alms, or the poor labourer for a daies work. Bid a Chriſtian to deny himſelf, to crucifie his fleſh; 'tis the ſame as if you bid him, deny thine enemy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge thy ſelf on thine enemy; ſuch revenge is ſweet: but O how pleaſant is it to him, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a life of praiſe? to live above in the light, in the love, in the joy of the Lord? to be ſearching, and ſtudying, and looking into, and admiring thoſe everlaſting treaſures of ſpiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights laid up in God? to behold his face, to live in his preſence, and to dwell in the light of his countenance? 'tis true, there is ſome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficulty, and irkſomneſs in the ſweeteſt works of religion, as far forth as the heart is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed and is yet carnal; deny my ſelf? morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie luſt? forſake my companions? withdraw from iniquity? Why what's this but to cut off my hand? to pluck out mine eyes? to tear my fleſh? walk with God? ſeek his face? dwell in his preſence?
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47970:51"/>
'tis all one, as to bid me feed on the air, wander on the mountains, dwell in the wilderneſs; and as much pleaſure can I find, in the one as in the other. 'Tis ſo indeed, as far as thou remaineſt carnal; the Lord God and all his ways are a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, a land of darkneſs</hi> to thee; but as much as thou haſt of this new heart, ſo much eaſe and pleaſure, thou wilt find herein.</p>
               <p>Deſponding ſoul; thou ſaiſt, thou art yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and haſt little knowledge of the way of the Lord; but behold a new light to lead thee. Thou art yet carnal, and thy heart is contrary, and ever quarrelling at it; but the new nature will end the old quarrel. Thou art weak and impotent, the work is too hard for thee, if thou lovedſt it never ſo well; but what will this be; when thou art en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with power from on high?</p>
               <p>O Friend wouldſt thou indeed live this new life, get this new heart. But oh there lies the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; how or where ſhall I get it? Why, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Covenant, there it lies for thee. But how ſhall I get it thence? why hath the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give it thee? take the word from his mouth, and put it into thine own; turn the <hi>word of promiſe,</hi> into a <hi>prayer?</hi> Doth he ſay [I will give]? let thy ſoul anſwer, [give Lord] give me this new heart. I am weary Lord, and thou art weary alſo of this wicked heart, at once eaſe thy ſelf and me; Take away this, and give me a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heart. Turn the word of promiſe into a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and then turn the <hi>word of Prayer,</hi> into a <hi>word of Faith.</hi> He ſays [I will give] let thy Faith ſay, [thou wilt give] I ſhall have it; ſince thou haſt ſaid, thy ſervant alſo may boldly ſay [Thou wilt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47970:52"/>
do it.] Thou wilt give me a better heart. Farewell my old ſins, luſts, and companions; farewell mine old pleaſures, and ways; now for heaven in earneſt, now welcome the ſtrait gate, the new and living way. Old things are paſt away, all things ſhall become new. Turn the word of promiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a prayer, turn thy prayer into a word of Faith, and God will turn the word of Faith into <hi>a word</hi> of <hi>Command. Bee it according to thy word.</hi> Let there be a new light, let there bee a new law, let there bee a new power; let there no more bee a ſpirit of fear in this heart, but a ſpirit of power, of love, and of a ſound mind. And as when he ſaid in the creation of the great world, <hi>Let there bee light,</hi> let there bee a Firmament, let there bee a Sun and Moon, <hi>It was ſo:</hi> ſo when he ſhall ſay, in the new creation of this little world, let there bee light, let there bee love, let there bee power; let us again make man in our image, after our own likeneſs; <hi>It ſhall be ſo.</hi> The Lord hath ſaid [I will,] let thy Prayer ſay [Do it Lord] let thy Faith ſay [thou wilt do it] and God will ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> ſo be it.</p>

As their breathings go up as ſweet incenſe, ſo his beams come down with like ſweetneſs to them. As 'twas ſaid of Chriſt, ſo of God: <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. The Name of the Lord <hi>is an ointment poured forth.</hi> Why what is his Name? <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. This is his Name. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful, and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth; keeping mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin.</hi> Oh what a bundle of myrrhe, what a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſpices, is here encloſed? what a ſweet ſmelling ſavour doth it ſend forth to them who have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil?</p>
               <p>The Name of the Lord is a precious ointment,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47970:59"/>
and the knowledge of God, is this <hi>ointment poured forth.</hi> Where God is known in the ſoul, there his ſweet ſavour is ſhed abroad. The thoughts of God are pretious, the wayes of God are pleaſant to them, that underſtand them. His fruit was ſweet unto my taſte. O the ineffable pleaſures of Religion! the carnal world count it a jejune and inſipid thing; they cannot taſte; and no wonder, for they do not ſee the things of God, <hi>nor can they, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Let God be ſavingly known, and then you will find what the ſavour of his Knowledge is. This light is ſweet, it is a pleaſant thing to behold this Sun. O my ſoul, let thy walks, let thy dwellings bee in this garden of the Lord; let the Sun ſhine, and the ſmell of his ſpices ſhall flow forth unto thee. O my Lord, ſhed abroad thy ſweet ointments, let the ſmell of thy garments refreſh my ſoul. Let mee taſte and ſee, let me ſee, and I ſhall taſte, that the Lord is gracious.</p>
               <p>Vaniſh all yee carnal pleaſures, and ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; theſe roſe-buds rot, the flowers of your gardens wither, dead Flyes are in all your oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the light of the Lord hath ſhined all your glories into darkneſs.

               <p>Hee that hath known the Lord, hath more or leſs according to the meaſure of his knowledge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the reliſh and ſweetneſs of it; and what hee hath received in, hee ſends forth before men; he hath received, and hee is a ſweet ſavour.

the ſweetneſs of God unto men. They are of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury lips, and of ſavoury lives; the ſavour of their graces is ſhed abroad in the Churches of Chriſt. Carnal hearts ſend forth a ſtench, inſtead of a ſweet ſmell; they are all rottenneſs, the ſavour of a ſepulchre is all they have. Their waies ſtink, their words ſtink, their very breath ſmells of a rotten heart. Yea, the very beſt they have, their pleaſures ſtink, their garments, their gallantry, their powders, and perfumes, and ſweet odours ſtink, of their proud, and vain, and ſenſual hearts. But O what a ſent do their ulcers, and their excrements, their oathes, and their curſes, and their ſcoffs, and their lyes ſend forth? Sinners, learn to know the Lord, and this will quickly change your ſavour. And you that know any thing of God, think not that your knowledge is ſaving till your ſouls have received in, and your waies do ſend forth the ſavour of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>The laſt of theſe, <hi>the ſavour of this Knowledge,</hi> the pleaſure that it brings in to the ſoul, though <hi>taken alone,</hi> it is but of uncertain ſignification; there may bee ſome pleaſure and joy ariſe from the common Knowledge of God; and ſometimes but little taſte, where there is the truth of Religion. But taken <hi>in conjunction</hi> with the former, where is found both the <hi>power, and the ſavour,</hi> the evidence of its ſoundneſs will be more full.

With my ſoul have I deſired thee, with my ſpirit within mee will I ſeek thee. Pſal. 38.9. <hi>Lord, all my deſire is before thee;</hi> 'tis not all my deſires, but my deſire; thou ſeeſt all, and 'tis all but <hi>one deſire.</hi> Hee deſires pardon, hee deſires peace, hee deſires help, and the heealing of his wounds; but all this is but one deſire. God is all. <hi>One thing have I deſired,</hi> Pſal. 27.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>thirſting</hi> of the ſout. Pſal. 42.2. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God. Thirſting</hi> is the extremity of deſire; hunger and thirſt are the appetite or deſire heightened; violent and painful appetites; my ſoul thirſteth, and is in pain till it be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>longing</hi> of the ſoul. Pſal. 63.1. <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee, my ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is.</hi> Longing cauſeth <hi>languiſhing,</hi> and abortions, if it be not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Pſal. 119.20. <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longing deſire it hath to thy judgments. My heart panteth, my fleſh faileth, the light of mine eyes is gone from me,</hi> Pſal. 38.10.</p>

4. <hi>Calling</hi> after God, Pſal. 4.1. <hi>Hear mee (when I call,) O God of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Calling upon God, is the voice of deſires. The deſiring ſoul will not keep ſilence; the tongue, the eye, the ears, the hands, the knees, muſt all be ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, when the flame is once kindled within.</p>
               <p n="5">5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Crying</hi> after the Lord. This is an expreſſion anſwering the <hi>thirſting</hi> of the ſoul. Crying is a paſſionate, and importunate praying. <hi>I cryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord with my whole heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.145.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Crying out</hi> after God. This is the manner of the longing ſoul. Crying out, notes more than bare crying; loud cryes, ſtrong cryes, forced out by a paroxiſme of love, or an agony the ſoul is in. Pſal. 84.2. <hi>My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my fleſh [cryeth out] for the living Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Following hard</hi> after the Lord, Pſal. 63.8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee.</hi> This expreſſion is more comprehenſive, it notes, both all the workings, and breakings, and breathings of the ſoul within, and its diligent purſuing in the uſe of all outward means, and preſſing on after the Lord. All thoſe labourings, and watchings, and runnings, all that holy violence, wherewith a Saint preſſes into the Kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>Put all this together, and you will ſee the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and influence the Lord hath on holy Souls, to the drawing of them after him, they are in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Heaven-vvard; deſiring, thirſting, longing, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, crying, crying out, follovving hard after him. What aileth theſe ſouls? vvhat's the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vvith them? vvhat vvould they have? <hi>Judg.</hi> 19.23. What aileth thee ſaid the <hi>Danites</hi> once
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47970:66"/>
to <hi>Micah,</hi> that thou comeſt thus after us? vvhat aileth thee? Why, you have taken avvay my Gods, and vvhat have I more? VVhat aileth theſe crying, longing, running Souls? vvhy, 'tis after their God they cry, 'tis after their God they run, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.20. Go back <hi>Eliſha,</hi> ſaid once the Prophet to him, vvhen hee had caſt his Mantle on him; Go back, for vvhat have I done unto thee? VVhat haſt thou done? enough to hold me from going back, there vvent vertue vvith the Mantle; the Mantle fell on his heart, as vvell as his back, and drevv it after the Prophet. Should you ſay thus to theſe, go back ſoul, go back from follovving thy God, for vvhat hath hee done unto thee? Oh hee hath gotten mine heart; no, no; I cannot go back, hee is my God, and vvhat have I more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The end <hi>guides</hi> and directs to means: <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I go from thee? thou hast the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The end <hi>governs;</hi> I ſhall put theſe both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what is it that Governs ſinners but their ends, this points them out their work, and their way, this holds them to their work, and keeps them in their way; what ever fetters, and chains, their luſts are to them 'tis their carnal ends, to which they are in bondage; theſe are they that Lord it over them, and hereupon it's impoſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a ſinner to make a through change of his way, till hee hath changed his ends; herein ſtands the converſion of a ſinner, in the changing of his ends; when hee ceaſes to bee any longer to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to his fleſh, to the world, and for a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happineſs, and is brought about to pitch on
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47970:66"/>
God as his portion, and happineſs, to whom hee devotes, and dedicates himſelf; there's converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Sin is our turning away, and converſion is turning back to our God. Beloved, conſider not barely <hi>how,</hi> but <hi>to what</hi> you live; not onely what you <hi>do,</hi> but what you <hi>would have;</hi> and never count your ſelves truely Godly, what-ever of God bee in your way; till God bee in your heart, and eye; Hee that hath firſt choſen God, and therefore a Godly life; whoſe Godlineſs of life, ſprings forth as the fruit of his choice of the Lord, that's a Godly man.</p>
               <p>God Governs as our <hi>King,</hi> and as our <hi>End,</hi> as our King by his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> as our End by his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency;</hi> by his worthineſs and goodneſs, as our King by <hi>Laws,</hi> as our end by love; Love will find out our way, will tell all our wandrings, will check us for our ſins, ſweeten our labours, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us on our courſe, cut out our way through dangers and difficulties, and keep us in our way till wee come to the fruition of our end; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis ſaid by the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 1.9. <hi>The Law is not for a Righteous man;</hi> Love will ſave the law a labour, the Law is not for a Righteous man, not ſo much at leaſt as for ſinners; not as to the coertion of it, though ſtill as to its obligation, the conſtraint of Love will much ſuperſede the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of Laws.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The end, <hi>Rewards, they have their Reward.</hi> Mat. 6. that is, they have their end, the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for devout and charitable men, was the end of their Devotion and Charity: They pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and faſted, and gave almes, for no other end; and the obtaining that reputation, was their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47970:67"/>
                  <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, they have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God is the reward of his Saints, Gen. 15.1. <hi>I am thy exceeding great reward,</hi> Iſa. 46.4. <hi>My judgement is with the Lord, and my reward with my God.</hi> God is the reward they [ſhall] receive, and the reward they look to receive, Heb. 11.29. <hi>Moſes</hi> had [reſpect] to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Argument is weighty, which Chriſt us'd to diſſwade his Diſciples from being in their Devotions, in their Alms-deeds, as the Phariſees and Hypocrites are; who disfigured their countenances in their faſts; who ſounded a Trumpet to proclaim their Alms, <hi>Bee yee not like them, for they have their reward.</hi> The Argument was ſtrong to the Diſciples, who being men of another Spirit, could not bee ſatisfied with ſuch a reward.</p>
               <p>In theſe two things Saints greatly differ from the men of this world; 1. They are not willing to defer their Duties till hereafter, and</p>
               <p n="2">2. They dread it to have their reward here, they would diſpatch their work, and are willing to go upon truſt for their wages: Sinners would have their wages in hand, and bee truſted for their work till hereafter; they would bee happy here, and can bee content to ſtay for holineſs till hereafter; 'tis ſoon enough to bee Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But Oh! it would bee a dreadful word to Saints, <hi>there are thy good things;</hi> take them, theſe are thy reward, theſe are not their end; and therefore they cannot take them for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

Poor fooliſh worldlings, how are you diſ-joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? how are your weary hearts ſcattered through the ends of the earth? how many maſters do you ſerve? how many matters have you to minde? you weary your ſelves in the greatneſs of your way, and what is your reward? What the fields can give, you have; what your ſheep, or your oxen can give you have; what your beds, or your tables, or your houſes, or your cloathes can give you have; here a little, and there a little, you get up, your beds give you eaſe, your houſes ſhelter, your ſports and companions pleaſure, your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites honour; and that little you can pick up here and there, this is your reward. Verily I ſay unto you, you have your revvard; unhappy ſouls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are troubled and carefull about many things, for nothing; <hi>one thing is needful;</hi> and if yet yee will be wiſe, chuſe that good part, which ſhall not bee taken from you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This one heart hath but one thing to do,</hi> Philip. 3.13. <hi>This one thing I do.</hi> There are all things in that one thing; all things needful. How many things ſoever his hand findeth to do, all is but one. Hee intends in all, God. A renewed heart deſigns God, and is making God-wards in all hee does. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever journy he goes, 'tis God is his home; whatever race he runs, 'tis God is his mark, and prize. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever battel hee fights, againſt fleſh and blood, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt principalities and powers, 'tis that hee may cut his way through all to his God. What-ever he does, hee does it for God; what-ever hee ſuffers, hee ſuffers for God. When hee hears, or faſts, or prayes, 'tis all for God. <hi>When yee faſted, did yee at all faſt to me?</hi> Yes to thee, a Chriſtian is able
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47970:68"/>
to ſay; hee hath many things to pray for, and faſt for; hee hath bread, and cloaths, and friends, and health, and ſafety, and liberty, to pray for; but in all, hee prayes for God. Hee entitles God to all hee hath, and marks it up for him, and he ſees and enjoyes God in all hee has; hee will not own that for a mercy, that hath not God in it, and is not a foot or wing, to carry him on towards him. And therefore what-ever hee begs to himſelf, 'tis that he may have it for God. What hee gives, he gives to God; whom hee forgives, 'tis for the Lords ſake; whether hee eats, or drinks, or works, or buyes, or ſells, or what-ever elſe hee does, hee does it all to the glory of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. For him hee prayes, for him he waits, for him he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for him hee ſuffers, for him hee lives, to him hee dies. <hi>To me to live is Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.21. <hi>according to my earneſt expectation and my hope, that in nothing I ſhall bee aſhamed, but that with all bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as alwayes, ſo now alſo Chriſt may bee magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in my body, whether it be by life or by death.</hi> This is the one thing hee intends, this is the one thing he ſeeks, in all, take his whole courſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee can ſay with the Apoſtle. <hi>This one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behinde, and reaching forth unto thoſe things that are before, I preſs toward the mark, for the price of the high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>. As hee looks ſtrait on, ſo hee walks ſtrait on to his mark. Hee doth not look one way, and row another. Hee is a <hi>Jacob;</hi> a plain man, a plain-dealing man; a <hi>Nathanael,</hi> in whom is no guile. Hee turns his inſide outwards; his life is not a <hi>Cloak,</hi> but a <hi>Commentary</hi> on his heart. The expoſitours of his inward man. His end is in his heart, and his heart is in his face, in his tongue, in his duties, and all his wayes. He is no Politician. 2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>Not in fleſhly wiſdom;</hi> his Religion is not <hi>a blind,</hi> or a device to delude the ſimple, hee is down-right, and in earneſt in all hee does. Hee does the ſame thing he ſeems to do; his praying is praying indeed; his faſting, and almes are ſuch indeed; his very profeſſion is practice; he would not believe, nor make others believe, but that hee is what hee is. Hee ſeeks not commendation from men, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation with God. His deſign is not inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to commend himſelf to the good opinion, though hee would bee made manifeſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of others. Hee would not bee a <hi>lye or a cheat.</hi> Hee abhorres all lying, but moſt of all a <hi>religious</hi> lye. He would not lye for God, much leſs againſt him; ſuch a lye is as blaſphemy to him. Hee loves not Images; hee would have a <hi>ſoul</hi> in all his practices. A prayer without a ſoul, a ſacrifice without an heart, a religious carkaſs is an abomination to him. Hee would not make ſuch a noble <hi>medium</hi> as Religion, to ſerve to ſo baſe an end, as the ſerving the fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:47970:69"/>
Hee hath other work to do than to ſerve times or tables; then to pleaſe himſelf or men; than to ſerve wills, or humours, or luſts; hee hath a ſoul, a conſcience, a God to look after; he hath but one buſineſs to do, but one Maſter to ſerve; if hee be a Magiſtrate, he rules for God; if he bee a Miniſter, hee preaches for God; if he bee a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, he educates for God; if hee bee a Maſter hee governs for God; to him he dedicates himſelf and his houſe; hee writes on his doors, this is <hi>Bethel,</hi> this is none other but the houſe of God. If he be a childe or a ſervant, he obeyes in the Lord and for the Lord; he knows he hath to do with God in all hee does; when hee is dealing with men, with his friends, with his family, in his calling, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, in all hee hath to do with God: and hee can take comfort in nothing, but what God will take pleaſure in. <hi>Thou haſt no pleaſure in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thou loveſt truth in the inward parts.</hi> And there's no truth in the inward parts, but when there's truth alſo in the outward parts: when the heart, and tongue, and wayes agree. 'Tis vain to ſay, mine heart is good, when the ways are naught. A falſe tongue, deceitful wayes: will give the lye to the heart. Hee cannot ſubſiſt, longer than hee hath ſmiles from heaven. Communion with God is his life, his all is in God. His heart dies, when that fountain is ſtopp'd. If hee cannot have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and boldneſs in the preſence of God, hee can no longer look himſelf in the face, but bluſhes and hangs downs his head with ſhame. Hee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues not either the applauſe, or the ſcorns of men, ſo hee may have a witneſs of his acceptance with God. O Lord, doſt thou regard? wilt thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47970:69"/>
of me? 'tis enough. Let all the world call me, <hi>Thou Fool, Thou Phariſee, Thou Hypocrite,</hi> ſo the Lord will ſay, <hi>my childe,</hi> 'tis well. 'Tis falſely ſpoken, 'tis fooliſhly, 'tis weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done; 'tis pride, 'tis ſingularity, 'tis ſcrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; thus the world cry; let them alone oh my ſoul, I will hearken what the Lord God will ſay; if hee ſaies, <hi>Thou haſt been faithful;</hi> I will hearken what conſcience will ſay, if it ſays <hi>well done,</hi> let all elſe ſay what they pleaſe; this is my rejoycing, mine onely rejoycing, <hi>the teſtimony of my conſcience, that in all ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not in fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but by the grace of God I had my converſation in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Heartily.</hi> What-ever hee does for God, he does it with a good will. Hee hath caſt up all his buſineſs into one, and hee is <hi>intent</hi> upon it. Hee works righteouſneſs, as ſinners work wickedneſs; <hi>with both hands, earneſtly,</hi> Micah 7.3. Hee is reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in good earneſt, hee prayes in good earneſt, he hears in good earneſt, hee runs in good earneſt; the powers of his ſoul being all united in one cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, run more ſtrongly, his many ſprings falling all into one ſtream, make a river, that bears down all bayes before it. The Pſalmiſt prays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.11. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite mine heart to fear thy Name.</hi> Unite my heart to thee, and unite mine heart in it ſelf, that it may all run toward thee. Unite my heart to fear, and ſo unite my heart to love thy name, unite mine heart to ſerve, and follow, and live to thee. As if he ſhould have ſaid, O my God, mine heart is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and diſcompoſed, ſcattered up and down, I know not where; my pleaſures have a part, my eſtate hath a part, my friends have a part, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47970:70"/>
hath a part, there's little or none left for God; I have too many things to fear, too many things to love, and care for, too many things to ſerve and follow, to follow the Lord with any ſtrength or intention of mind. Call in all Lord, all my parts, all my powers, command their joynt and united attendance upon thee. 1 Pet. 1.13,14,15. <hi>Gird up the loyns of your mind, and bee ſober, and hope to the end</hi> (in the original 'tis <hi>hope perfectly) for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jeſus Christ. As obedient children not faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your ſelves according to the former luſts in your ignorance, but as hee which hath called you is holy, ſo bee yee holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> Gird up the loyns of your minds. Gird and bee ſober, gird and hope perfectly, gird and bee obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, gird and bee holy. Here 'tis true ungirt and unbleſt, ungirt and unholy: the girding is the gathering in the ſtrength of the heart to its work. Epheſ. 6.14. <hi>Stand with your loyns girt.</hi> [Stand] do not gird and ungird, ſtand alwayes girt; call in your hearts, and hold them in; be alwaies in a readineſs to every duty, in a readineſs againſt every temptation. Oh how looſe are wee! what looſe praying, and looſe hearing, and looſe meditation, and looſe walkings, do wee ſatisfie our ſelves with! our hearts are to ſeek, our thoughts and affections are gadding abroad, we know not where to finde them, and our work is done thereafter. Wee excuſe our non-proficiency in Religion, by our many hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances; by the difficulties of our work; but the great hindrance lies here, our loyns are ungirded, our hearts are not united in our work, nor intent upon it. When God and the things of eternity
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47970:70"/>
are gotten ſo deep into the heart, when there is ſuch a deep ſenſe, of the weight and importance, of the things that are eternal, abiding upon us, as over-powers; carnal objects, and looſens the heart from them; when wee feel the evidence, and the conſequence of theſe things commanding our whole ſoules after them, then there's Religion in earneſt; then wee go on and proſper. And thus 'tis with this one heart, there are not ſome light touches onely upon it; God is gotten deep into it, eternity is gotten deep into it, this is all; this is all I have to minde or do. My hope, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, my life, my ſoul, all hang upon this one thing; if I ſpeed well here, I am made for ever. <hi>What have I to do in the way of Egypt, or to drink of the waters of Sihor? what have I to do in the way of Aſſyria?</hi> what have I to do in the way of pleaſure? What have I to do in the way of the World? To build Tabernacles for my ſelf here below, or to drink the waters of mine own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteron? How little am I concerned in the intereſt of this fleſh? VVhat matter's it, what becomes of it, or which way it goes? My God, my God, my ſoul, my ſoul, there lies my concernment; of theſe let my care onely bee. Get thee behind me Satan, hold thy peace ſinful fleſh, keep ſilence worldly cares; hinder mee not, ſpeak no more to me of hearkening to you, away from mee ye evil-doers, I will keep the Commandements of my God; Let others do what they will, run whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they pleaſe, chuſe whom they will ſerve, what they will follow after; come my ſoul, follow thou the Lord, gird up thy loyns and come away; for the other world, for the other world; make

haſte, linger not, let others loyter as they will, eſcape for thy life, look not behinde thee, get thee up to the Mountain and live.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>One Heart, why 'tis never more two; Two men, a new man and an old, two Nations, two ſelfs, there are twins in the womb of every Saint; the ungodly ſeem more one than they, all for ſin, and for Hell; all dark, all hard, all but one ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Yet 'tis true, the Saints, and they onely have but this one heat; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The old heart is not an heart, the old ſelf is not the ſelf; this old man is not the man, this is not hee, that's the heart, that hath gotten the dominion, and the rule in the man. The new heart hath the dominion; though Sin as <hi>Eſau,</hi> bee the firſt born, yet the elder muſt now ſerve the younger; the old man is but a dead man, Col. 3.3. <hi>Yee are dead,</hi> that is, your old man is dead, your ſin is ſlain and Crucified with Chriſt, and when 'tis dead, you may ſay <hi>'tis not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The meaning plainly is, I will give them one heart; that is, a ſingle, ſincere upright heart; they ſhall bee no longer an Hypocritical people. If there bee ſomething of Hypocriſie in them, yet Hypocrites they ſhall no longer bee; their hearts ſhall bee upright before mee; ſincerity ſtands in pitching upon chuſing, and giving up our hearts to God, as our <hi>chief good,</hi> and <hi>laſt end.</hi> When God is our <hi>all,</hi> there is <hi>perfection,</hi> and when God is our <hi>chief,</hi> there is ſincerity. I ſay, when God is our all, when the world hath nothing left in us, to entice or draw out our ſouls after it, but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47970:71"/>
God carries them wholly without any the leaſt lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or luſting after ſinful objects, there's perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; This is not attainable here; the heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee thus perfectly one, till corruption hath put on incorruption; But though it bee not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,</hi> yet it may bee <hi>ſincerely</hi> one, and then 'tis ſo, when however, the fleſh hath too great an intereſt in it, and influence upon it, and often pulls it aſide, and puts it back; yet it ſtill bends its courſe Heaven wards, and that way the ſtream, and ſtrength of the ſoul is running, the fleſh will bee putting in for a part; it would have all, it would not take its turns with God; God will not take his turns with the fleſh, hee will have all or none; and the fleſh would not take its turnes with him; it is not contented with <hi>now and then,</hi> it would not bee ſerved in the fields, or in the ſhop, or at the Table, or in the bed onely, but in the Church, in the Chamber, in the Cloſet; 'twould carry away all from God, but if it cannot have all, 'twill divide with God; where-ever God is ſerved, the fleſh will bee putting in for its ſhare. The beſt of Chriſtians feel too great a truth in this; their frequent humblings, and mournings, and breakings, and ſelf-ſhamings before the Lord, are moſtly upon this account; This is the voice of their deepeſt groanings, and bittereſt tears; the burthens of their mournful groans. <hi>I cannot do the things that I would; when I would do good evil is preſent with me; with my minde I ſerve the Law of God, but with my fleſh the Law of ſin;</hi> Woe is me my ſoul, how am I ſtraitned? how am I divided Whither am I hurried? wherewithall do I come before thee Lord? Oh! what halting, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47970:72"/>
and diſtracted duties, do I ſerve my God withal? This fleſh eats up the fat, and the beſt; and onely the lame, and the lean, and the ſick, are left for a Sacrifice to the Lord. Woe is mee, <hi>my leanneſs, my leanneſs:</hi> my God, my God, how art thou ſerved? how art thou robbed of thy due? theſe ſtrangers are gotten into thy Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and eat up all thy pleaſant things, and what have they left thee?</p>
               <p>Such are their complaints, and their very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are their comfort, and the witneſs of their ſincerity, whilſt they can with openneſs of heart make their approach and appeal to God; yet thou art my Lord, thou art my God, and I will ſerve thee. I have choſen thee as mine heritage for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and I will wait for thy ſalvation. Hear the ſighing of thy priſoner, deliver thy captive; mine heart is with thee, let not this fleſh intrench upon thy light, let ſin no longer reign in my mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; let mee have no more to do with the Throne of iniquity, unty the cords, looſe the fetters, bring my ſoul out of priſon, ſearch mee, O Lord, and know mine heart, prove me, and know my thoughts; <hi>Is there any [way] of wickedneſs in mee?</hi> do I <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly go after the Commandments?</hi> Do I <hi>[regard] iniquity in mine heart?</hi> Here it lies, 'tis true, it warres, and raiſes tumults, and inſurrections againſt thee; but do I reſign up my ſelf to it? is it a pleaſure to mee? am I at peace with it? O Lord, thou knoweſt. I cannot get rid of it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe the things that I would, I cannot pray as I would, nor hear as I would, nor think, nor ſpeak, nor live as I would; whither I goe, ſin goes with mee; where I lodge, it lodges; If I ſit ſtill, it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47970:72"/>
abides with me; If I run from it, it follows me; I can neither reſt nor work, I can do nothing for it. I can do nothing for it, and yet bleſſed bee thy name, this one thing I do; what I cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, I follow after; I cannot conquer, yet I fight againſt it; I wreſtle with it, though it ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten give mee the fall. I truſt it not, though it flatter me; I love it not, though it feed mee; I proſtitute not my ſelf unto it, though it commits ſo many a rape upon mee; my heart is with thee Lord, my foot is making after thee; I groan, I travel in pain, waiting for thy redemption; till I die I vvill not give over. I will die fighting, I will die hoping, I vvill die praying, <hi>Save me, O Lord, make no long tarrying, O my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you have the deſcription of this one heart. It pitches on one end, and God is that end. It gives him the place of the end, hee is its firſt and laſt. It gives him the <hi>power</hi> of the end; this one thing the obtaining of God to be theirs, draws them on, guides, governs them, in their whole courſe, and is accepted by them as their onely and exceeding great reward. This inſtructs them, this rules, and encourages them, calls them off from ſin, calls them on to duty, carries them out in ſuffering; all their powers are united in this one buſineſs; all their arguments are reſolved into this one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all their rewards are ſumm'd up in this one reward. <hi>God ſhall bee glorified, and therein my ſoul ſhall bee ſatisfied; God ſhall bee mine, and glory ſhall bee his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all this wee ſee what this one heart means, but <hi>oh how little of this Grace have wee received?</hi> how many hearts have wee! how many gods have
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47970:73"/>
wee, to divide theſe hearts betwixt them? how ſmall a corner.</p>
               <p>How low a place, muſt the Lord take up with us if hee will have any at all? how often is hee made to ſtand aſide, or to ſtoop to a luſt, God made to give place to the devil? Is God our All indeed, have wee none elſe to pleaſe, have wee none elſe to ſerve? have wee no portion, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, no other God but the Lord? Is hee out <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> our firſt and our laſt? our ſpring and our ocean, our ſumme and our ſcope? the riſe and the reſt of all our motions? what-ever our tongues ſpeak, do our hearts alſo and our lives ſay, <hi>To mee to live is Christ?</hi> none but God? none but Chriſt? nothing but heaven, and glory? when wee are driving ſo hard for our fleſh, for our pride, for our eaſe, for our gain, when wee are ſo buſie this vvay, and ſo hearty and ſo zealous this vvay; vvhen theſe muſt have ſo great a ſhare in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Is this ſtill the voice, <hi>To me to live is Chriſt? Oh how little power</hi> hath the Lord vvith us! hovv far is it that the ſingle intereſt of God vvill carry our ſouls? hovv little is done purely for God? wee have often many ſtrings to our bow: there are ſome ſervices, wherein there is ſomething coming to the fleſh, as well as to the name of God. Some credit, or honour, ſome outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to bee gotten by Religion; but when all the other ſtrings crack, but this one; when there's nothing to move us but God, oh how weak do our motions grow? The fleſh often goes partner with God; there's a double trade driving in the ſame actions; a trade for heaven, and a trade earth together; there's ſomething to bee gotten
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47970:73"/>
by our religion, beſides what's coming to God; there are fields, and vineyards, and olive-yards, friends, and honours, and preferments; as it ſometimes falls out, when godlineſs is in the riſing ſide; and when 'tis thus, we go ſmoothly and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly on. <hi>Come ſee the zeal that I have for the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> But when the intereſt of God, and the fleſh divide, and part aſunder; when the fleſh is like to bee a loſer by our Religion; when God puts us on ſuch duty, as will ſpend upon the fleſh, and eat out, and devour its intereſt; when our hearts tell us as <hi>Deborah</hi> did <hi>Barak,</hi> Judg. 4. <hi>This will not bee for thine honour,</hi> or this will not bee for thine eaſe, or thy ſafety; then what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of our zeal? oh how heavily do we then drive on? how ſeldome is it that this word (yet God ſhall bee glorified) will ballance all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and confute all the croſs reaſonings of the fleſh, and carry us on our way, without and againſt it.</p>
               <p>How little hath the Lord of <hi>the government</hi> of us? if hee doth govern as <hi>a King,</hi> yet how little, <hi>as our end?</hi> how little doth goodneſs govern? how little will love do with us? wee muſt have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and ſeverity; wee muſt have ſpurres, and goads, and rods, and ſtripes, and ſcorpions too, and all little enough, to drive us back from thoſe other gods which wee have choſen, and to bring us on after the Lord. If the Law be not made for the righteous; if they need not a Law, then what are we, whom a Law will not ſuffice? if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, threatnings, terrours, penalties, judgments, can do no more upon us; if wee are yet ſo looſe, and ſo carnal, and ſo earthly, and ſo froward, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47970:74"/>
ſo falſe, and ſo formal, under ſevereſt diſcipline; if wee will not bee whip'd into more humility, ſpirituallity, ſelf-denial, watchfulneſs, care, activity, zeal; but are ſuch drones, and ſuch ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſuch earth-worms, and ſuch ſenſualliſts ſtill, under all the corrections and compulſions of the law; oh what ſhould we be, did wee want a law? were there nothing but love, to reſtrain us from ſin, and conſtrain and quicken us to duty?</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, <hi>have wee but one thing to do,</hi> in all wee do? ſometimes wee are buſie in <hi>doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Though there bee a Prayer in our mouths, the praiſes of God in our mouths; Chriſt, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, holineſs, glory, a new heart, a new life upon our tongues; there's nothing within; no prayer, no praiſe, no Chriſt, nor heaven; what have we been often doing, in the cloſet, in the family, in the congregation, when wee ſeemed to have been praying? nothing, nothing, but ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wind and good words. Sometimes we have <hi>too many things</hi> in our hearts; what a world of carnal devices, and fleſhly projects have wee wrapt up in the garment of our Religion? <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſheet had not a more heterogeneous miſcellany of creatures; <hi>four-footed beaſts, wilde beaſts, creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and fowls of the air;</hi> than our religious duties have of deſignes and ends. Wee have men to pleaſe, our pride, our bellies, to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to; wee bring our farms, and our oxen, and our trades before the Lord; are not our hearts, which ſhould bee the <hi>houſes of prayer,</hi> the <hi>houſes of merchandiſe?</hi> are wee not <hi>talking, or purſuing, or in a journey, or a ſleep,</hi> or driving bargains? O Chriſtians, if wee were privy to one anothers
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47970:74"/>
hearts, as God is privy to them; what abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſhould wee ſee, brought into the holy places? What monſters would our moſt ſacred ſervices appear? VVhich whilſt the out-ſide is onely viewed, are applauded and admired. Is this our ſingleneſs of heart? Oh! for ſhame, and bluſhing, and confuſion of face; Oh! for a <hi>Vail</hi> to hide ſuch hearts from the jealous eyes of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, a <hi>varniſh</hi> a fair out-ſide, hides all from men; but nothing but a dark Vail, of ſhame and ſorrow, and tears, and repentance; <hi>a Vail dipt in Blood,</hi> in the blood of Chriſt; will hide them from the eyes of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Oh how little plainneſs and ſingleneſs of heart is there, <hi>in our ordinary courſe;</hi> in our dealings and converſings in the VVorld? how little faith, or truth is there in us? how little truſt is there to us? what doubling, what deceitful dealing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding, over-reaching, undermining, are wee guilty of? how falſe are wee in our promiſes? how inſignificant are our words? what an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſound do they give? our <hi>yea</hi> may often ſtand for <hi>nay,</hi> and our nay for yea, Pſal. 12.2. <hi>They ſpeak vanity, every one with his neighbour, with flattering lips and a double heart do they ſpeak; truſt yee not in a friend, put not confidence in a guide.</hi>

               <p>Chriſtians, hath God promiſed to give you one heart? Let it bee once ſaid, <hi>this day is this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fulfilled;</hi> O may you bee the accompliſhment of this good word. Hath God promiſed to give you one heart? Do not you ſay, <hi>but I will not take it;</hi> two are better than one: I have found ſo much the ſweet of deceit, that there's no life like it; Hath God ſaid, I will give one heart? let not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one among you ſay, <hi>But I fear he will not.</hi> Make not the promiſe of God of none effect, either by your impiety or unbelief: Doth God promiſe to give this one heart? hee that promiſed it, doth alſo require it. Bee thy ſelf Chriſtian: Let it bee ſaid thou art what thou art, bee true, bee but one; have but one heart, and let thy one heart have but one tongue, but one face; and but one thing to do. Beware of hypocriſie, beware of carnal policy; make not thy God to ſerve thy fleſh; call not the ſerving of thy fleſh, a ſerving of God, and make not thy ſerving of God to bee a ſerving of the fleſh. Bee not divided betwixt God and the World: O how eaſie would our lives bee, did we finde our whole ſouls running one way? taking up w th God as the adequate object of all our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers? the marke of all our motions, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all our labours? did all our ſtreams emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty themſelves into this Ocean, and all our lines meet in this one center? Did God onely draw and allure our hearts, and the ſincerity of our hearts, give motion to all our wheels? Guide our eyes,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47970:75"/>
govern our tongues, order our ſteps, animate our duties, direct and quicken us in all our goings? Oh how ſweet, oh how beautiful, were ſuch a life? the Sympathy betwixt our hearts and end, there's <hi>ſweetneſs;</hi> the harmony of our hearts and waies, there's <hi>beauty.</hi> O how ſweet are the drawings of love, the free and full cloſure of our Spirits with God, diſſolving themſelves into his Will acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, reſting ſatisfyed in his goodneſs, is a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which no man knows, but hee that taſtes it; the harmony of the power of the ſoul within its ſelf of its motions and actions in the life, there's the beauty, which will eclipſe the glory of the world. Chriſtian bee it thus with thee, and thou haſt the bleſſing, that covenant bleſſing, which the Lord hath promiſed, in ſaying, <hi>I will give them one heart.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>AN Heart of Fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. <hi>I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an Heart of Fleſh.</hi> The old heart is a ſtone; cold as a ſtone, dead as a ſtone, hard as a ſtone; but I will take away the ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh.</p>
               <p>An heart of fleſh, is a <hi>ſoft and tender heart; Fleſh can feel</hi> any thing thats contrary to it, puts it to pain; Sin makes it ſmart; it cannot kick, but it is againſt the pricks, by its rebellion, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47970:76"/>
reſiſtance againſt the Lord, it receives a wound; it cannot hit, but it hurts it ſelf. A ſoft hand gets nothing by laying on, on an hedge of thorns. A ſoft heart when it hath been medling with ſin, is ſure to ſmart for it. It can neither eſcape the pain, nor yet endure it: and what it cannot bear, 'twill take warning to avoid it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fleſh will bleed.</hi> A ſoft heart will mourn, and melt, and grieve, when hard hearts are moved at nothing. <hi>Fleſh will yield.</hi> Its apt to receive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. The power of God will awe it; his juſtice fear it; his mercy melt it; his holineſs humble it, and leave the ſtamp, and image of it upon it. And as the Attributes, ſo the Word and Works of God, will make ſign upon it. Who ſets a ſeal upon a ſtone? or what print will it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? upon the wax, the print will abide. <hi>God ſpeaks once and twice,</hi> but man, hardned man will not regard it. Neither his Word, nor his rod, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ſpeaking, nor his ſmiting will make any ſigne on ſuch hearts. 'Tis the heart of fleſh that hears and yields. And with ſuch hearts the Lord delights to bee dealing. Acts 28. <hi>The heart of this people is waxed groſs;</hi> they will not hear, they will not underſtand; and the next word is, <hi>away to the Gentiles,</hi> they will hear. <hi>Hee</hi> will no more write his Law on <hi>tables of ſtone:</hi> hee'l write <hi>in fleſh;</hi> there the impreſſion will take, and go the deeper: and therefore, where-ever hee intends to write, hee prepares his table: makes this ſtone fleſh, and then engraves upon it.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Ante factum.</hi> Or before the commiſſiion. Whileſt it is under a temptation, or feels the firſt motion to ſin. A tender heart ſtartles, ſtarts back at the ſight of a ſin, as at the ſight of a devil, Gen. 39.9. <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> the manner of the ſpeech, preſents <hi>Joſeph</hi> as a man in a fright, ſtartled at the uglineſs of the motion. So <hi>David,</hi> when hee had an opportunity, and a temptation to ſlay <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.11. rejects it with an <hi>abſit.</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. <hi>The Lord forbid that I ſhould ſtretch forth my hand againſt the Lords anointed.</hi> And that not onely at the higher and greater, but it reſiſts the little ones, the ſmalleſt of ſins. Is it not a little one? is no plea with it. Little or great, 'tis a ſin, and that's enough.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſt factum.</hi> After the Commiſſion; if it hath been brought on upon ſin, yet it cannot go out with it. The skirt of <hi>Saul</hi>'s garment, was too heavy for <hi>David</hi>'s heart to bear. His heart ſmote him pteſently, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. Sin in the review, looks dreadfully. Its pleaſant flowers quickly turn to thorns; it pricks the heart how much ſoever it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47970:77"/>
pleas'd the eye. It ordinarily enters by the eye; and often runs out the ſame way it came in; runs out in tears. <hi>When hee thought thereon, hee wept.</hi> At leaſt, it warns, and makes more watchful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thou ſeeſt what 'tis, take heed; take it for a warning, and do no more. The pain of ſin, if it do not force a tear, 'twill ſet a watch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Of duty.</hi> A tender heart will neither ſlight a ſin, nor neglect a duty. It's loth to grieve and offend, and careful to ſerve and pleaſe the Lord. It would not that he ſhould ſuffer by it, nor ſo much as loſe his due. It watches <hi>againſt</hi> ſin, and unto du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It cares how to pleaſe the Lord, and its care is tender. It would not diſpleaſe by its <hi>neglects</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances;</hi> all muſt bee done <hi>that ought,</hi> and <hi>as it ought</hi> to be done. It will neither ſtand out with its offering, nor will it offer an unclean thing. It conſiders not onely what, but how. Both mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner, ſubſtance and circumſtance, all muſt bee right, or 'tis not at eaſe. It will keep <hi>time,</hi> and as much as may bee, keep <hi>touch</hi> with the Lord in every point. It is not ſatisfied that it prayes ſometimes, it would not loſe a praying time. God will not, and it cannot loſe a duty. It would neither loſe by non-performance, nor loſe what is performed. It would neither leave undone, nor do amiſs; any failing, not onely in the matter, but in the principle, end, affection, intention; any failing pains.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In point <hi>of ſuffering.</hi> A ſoft heart will not bee careful what, or how much, but why, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what account, hee ſuffers. Will neither ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhun the croſs, nor run upon it unwarrantably. He waits for <hi>a call,</hi> and then follows. Hee is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47970:77"/>
under the hand of the Lord, but not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; can be touched with an affliction, though not offended at it. <hi>The hand of the Lord hath touched mee.</hi> Hee ſuffers more than his own, his brethrens ſufferings. His brethrens burthens, all lie on his ſhoulders. Hee weeps in their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, bleeds in their wounds, his heart is bound in their chains. As the care, ſo the trouble of all the Churches, come daily upon him. <hi>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> hee eſpouſes all the ſufferings of Chriſt as his own. In all his afflictions hee is afflicted.</p>

God commands, caſt yee out, caſt yee out, come off from all your wickedneſſe, and evil waies, and I will receive you; No, though Conſcience would, the Will cannot come, whatever rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and tearings; whatever terrours and torments, and worryings, ſuch ſouls are at any time under, whatever ſtings, and plagues, and fires, they find their ſins to be in their ſouls and bones; what-ever wiſhings and wouldings they wring forth, that they were well rid of theſe plagues; whileſt the will is ſtill for them, there's an hard heart; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably hard; there's none of this heart of fleſh.

His reproach is grievous to him that loves, for this is the cloud that takes God out of ſight. Hee loves and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and would that God ſhould bee loved and honoured of all; hee fears, and would that the whole world ſhould fear him. Hee would receive in his own breaſt, every arrow that's ſhot againſt his maker; hee would that his own name, and ſoul might ſtand betwixt his God, and all reproach, and diſhonour. Hee would bee vile, ſo the Lord may bee glorious; ſo God may increaſe, he's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to decreaſe. Hee's not ſo tender of his own heart, and bowels, as of the holineſs of his God. Hee would ſuffer, and die, and bee nothing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that God ſhould not bee all in all.

Love is large; hee that loves hath a large heart, hee can never receive, or do too much; hee would have all hee can, and he would give all hee hath to the Lord.

               <p>It is impatient of divine diſpleaſure, and thence 'tis grievous to it that it does diſpleaſe; thence it quarrels with ſin, and falls ſo foul with it ſelf for it.

Put all this now together, and you have the heart of fleſh which the Covenant promiſes, a <hi>Tender Heart;</hi> an heart that is tender of ſin and duty, that carefully ſhuns ſin, or is ſure to ſmart for it; that neither ſlights ſin, nor duty; that ſayes not of the one or the other; 'tis but a little one; that can feel ſufferings, but not fret at them, a <hi>Tender Conſcience;</hi> that will neither winck at ſin, nor excuſe the ſinner, that will not hold the ſinner guiltleſs; nor ſay unto the wicked, thou art righteous; that will not bee ſmitten, but it will ſmite again, that will give due warning, and due correction, a flexible tractable heart; that will not reſiſt and rebel; that ſayes unto the Lord, what wilt thou have mee to do? and will not ſay of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, hee will have; <hi>any thing but this.</hi> A wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ductile heart, ſtiffe againſt nothing but ſin, that a word from Heaven, will lead to any thing. An <hi>Heart of Love;</hi> that bears good will to the Lord, and all that hee does or requires; in which good will lies, radically every good work; that ſaies not of any duties or ſufferings, this is too great, or of any ſin, this is nothing; that would bee any thing, or nothing; So God may bee all. That would rather bee diſpleaſed, than diſpleaſe; that is not diſpleaſed, where God is pleaſed. <hi>A trembling Heart,</hi> that fears more than it ſees, and flies from what it fears, whom fear makes to beware. <hi>A melting Heart,</hi> a mourning heart, that wounds it ſelf in the wounds it hath given to the Lord, and his Name; that can grieve in love, and can love and grieve, where it cannot weep. In ſumme, 'tis an heart that can feel, that can bleed, that can weep;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47970:84"/>
or at leaſt that can yeild and ſtoop, where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not weep, nor feel but little, that will eaſily bee commanded, where it is not ſenſibly melted, this is a ſoft heart, this is the heart of fleſh; I will take away the ſtone, and give them an heart of fleſh.</p>
               <p>Oh what a bleſſing is ſuch an heart! what a plague is an hard heart! oh what <hi>priſoners</hi> are the men of this evil world: in priſon under Sathan, in priſon under ſin, bound under a curſe, ſhut up under unbelief, and impenitence: the hard heart, is the iron-gate, that ſhuts them in that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get out. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. Oh what <hi>an hoſpital</hi> is this world become: of blind, and lame, and ſick, and creeples, and wounded creatures! whence are all the calamities and diſtreſſes that befall them, but from the hardneſs of their hearts? the ſtone in their hearts breeds all their diſeaſes, brings all their calamities: hath blinded their eyes, and broken their bones, and waſted their eſtates: there is not one miſery that befalls them, but they may write up over it, <hi>this is the hardneſs of my heart.</hi> Oh what <hi>a Sodom</hi> is this world become, for wickedneſs as well as for wrath: what drunkenneſs, what adulteries, what oaths, what blaſphemies, and all ſorts of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſins do every where abound! whence is all this, but from the hardneſs of mens hearts! if you ſay 'tis from other cauſes: 'tis from unbelief, from ignorance, from impotence, from tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; let it bee granted: yet ſtill 'tis from hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart. They are <hi>wilfully</hi> ignorant, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weak, vvilfully run into temptations; they ſhut their eyes, and ſtop their ears, they wil not ſee, they will not believe. Oh what loſſes do they ſuſtain!
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47970:85"/>
how many Sabbaths are loſt? how many Sermons are loſt? how many reproofs, counſels, correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are loſt? a Goſpel loſt, and ſouls thereby like to bee loſt for ever! oh what <hi>prodigies</hi> are they become? under all this ſin and miſery? and yet merry, jolly, laughing, and ſinging, and ſporting, and feaſting, and braving it out, as if nothing ail'd them. Feeling nothing of all that is come upon them, and fearing nothing of all that is coming. Warn them, reprove them, beſeech them, 'tis all but preaching to a ſtone. It may bee you have ſometimes wondred, to ſee a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of thieves in priſon, to bee drinking, and carouſing, and milking merry, when they know that in a few daies they muſt bee brought out, and hanged. When thou wondreſt at theſe, wonder at thy ſelf. What <hi>bitter complaints</hi> do wee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hear, even from the beſt of Saints! oh this hard heart, oh this ſtubborn ſpirit; I cannot mourn, I cannot ſtoop, I cannot ſubmit. Iſa. 63.17. <hi>Why haſt thou hardned our heart from thy fear?</hi> Or why haſt thou left us, or given us up to an hard heart? why haſt thou not ſoftened, and humbled, and broken us? thou haſt humbled us, and wee are not humbled; broken us, and wee are not broken; thou haſt broken our land, broken our peace, broken our backs, but the ſtone is not yet broken; oh for one breach more Lord; our hearts, our hearts, let theſe bee once broken; our ſtreets mourn, the Cities of our ſolemnities mourn, the wayes of <hi>Sion</hi> mourn, oh when wilt thou give us a mourning ſpirit?</p>
               <p>Oh what ſorrow-bitten ſouls are the Saints, for want of ſorrow! I mourn Lord, I lament, I weep,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47970:85"/>
but 'tis becauſe I cannot mourn, or lament as I ſhould; If I could mourn as I ought, I could bee comforted; if I could weep, I could rejoyce; if I could ſigh, I could ſing; if I could lament I could live; I die, I dye, mine heart dies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mee, becauſe I cannot cry: I cry Lord, but not for ſin, but for tears for ſin; I cry Lord, my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities cry, my bowels cry, my bones cry, my ſoul cries, my ſins cry, <hi>Lord, for a broken heart;</hi> and behold, yet I am not broken.</p>
               <p>The Rocks rent, the Earth quakes, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens drop, the Clouds weep, the Sun will bluſh, the Moon bee aſhamed, the foundations of the earth will tremble at the preſence of the Lord, but this heart will neither break nor tremble; O for a broken heart! If this were once done, might my ſoul have this wiſh, thenceforth my God might have his Will; what would bee hard, if my heart were tender? Labour would bee eaſie, pains would bee a pleaſure, burthens would bee light; Neither the Command nor the Croſs would bee any longer grievous, nothing would bee hard but ſin. Fear, where art thou? come and plough upon this Rock; Love where art thou? come and thaw this Ice, come and warm this dead lump; come and enlarge this ſtraitned ſpirit, then ſhall I run the way of his Commandements.</p>
               <p>Oh Brethren, how little, how very little of this tenderneſs is there to bee found amongſt the moſt of Chriſtians? <hi>The ſacrifice of God, is a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart;</hi> Oh how far muſt the Lord go to finde himſelf ſuch a Sacrifice? wee do but caſt ſtones up to Heaven, when wee lift up our hearts; 'Tis a wonder, that ſuch hearts as wee carry do not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47970:86"/>
break themſelves; that our marble weeps not; that if nothing elſe will do it, our hardneſs doth not make us relent; that wee ſhould ſo labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and complain of, and yet not bee ſick of the Stone.</p>
               <p>Broken hearts, yeilding and relenting ſpirits, tender conſciences, Oh where are they? afraid of ſin? tender of tranſgreſſing? or mourning under it? when ſhall it once bee? our luſts no more broken? our pride, our paſſion, our envy, our earthlineſs no more broken? So venturous on temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſo bold on ſin, ſuch liberty taken to tranſgreſs, ſuch mincing, and palliating, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing of ſin, as wee finde: Is this our broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? wee are tender, 'tis true; but of what? of diſhonouring God, of abuſing Grace, of neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Duty; of defiling Conſcience, of vvounding of our Souls? No, 'tis of our fleſh, that wee are ſo tender; tender of labour, tender of trouble, tender of our carkaſſes, of our credits, of our Names and reputations, a tender ſhoulder, a tender hand, a tender foot; they can bear nothing, nor do nothing; nothing can touch our fleſh, nothing can touch our Idols; our eaſe, or our eſtates, but wee ſhrink, and ſmart, and are put to pain. God may bee ſmitten and wee feel it not; the Goſpel may bee ſmitten, the Church may bee ſmitten, conſcience may bee ſmitten, and it moves us not; Wee can fear an affliction, fear a reproach, Oh did wee ſo much fear a temptation, or a ſin! wee cannot want bread but wee feel it, wee cannot want cloathes, or an houſe, or a friend, but wee feel it; Wee cannot want our ſleep, our quiet, our pleaſure, our reſpects from men, but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47970:86"/>
wee feel it, any thing that pinches upon our fleſh pierces our hearts. Wee cannot pine, or languiſh in our bodies, but wee feel it; a feaver; or an ague, or a conſumption, or a dropſie, or any bodily ſickneſs; Oh it makes us ſick at heart; a froward yoak-fellow, an unthrifty ſervant, an ill neighbour, a ſcoffe, a ſleight cannot bee born; but Oh! how much ſin can bee born, while our fleſh will bear nothing? Oh! how can conſcience bear, and never complain?</p>
               <p>Chriſtians conſider, when our <hi>fleſh</hi> muſt be thus tendred, what ever come of it; muſt be tenderly fed, muſt have ſoft rayment, ſoft lodging, ſoft uſage, <hi>deal gently with it,</hi> though to maintain it, <hi>Conſcience</hi> muſt bee racked, and wracked and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>When our <hi>Wills</hi> cannot bee croſſed, our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites cannot bee denied, but a tumult follows, the ſoul is in an uproar; and conſcience mean while, muſt be denied, rated, and muſt go away in ſilence.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Word</hi> works no more, when the prints of it are not received; the power of it is reſiſted; when the <hi>rod</hi> works no more; when our ſtripes make no ſign, when the laſhes on our backs fall all beſides our hearts; when wee remain ſo vain, and ſo wanton, ſo wilful, and ſo carnal, and ſo earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; after the Lord hath been preaching, and whipping of us into a better frame, when wee ſtand upon our terms, keep our diſtances, our animoſities, our heats, and heighths of ſpirit, our cenſurings, our quarrellings one with another, Chriſtian with Chriſtian, Profeſſour with Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, after the Lord hath been beating us together,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47970:87"/>
to make us friends, and all to learn us more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and charity; Is this our brokenneſs? is this our tenderneſs? when upon any the Lords rougher dealing with us, ſpitting in our faces, throwing us on our backs, trampling us in the dirt, wee are yet no more brought on our knees; Is this our brokenneſs? when the Lord hath been awakening us out of ſleep, putting his ſpurres and goads in our ſides, to quicken us on our way; calling to us, <hi>ariſe ſleepers,</hi> put on ſluggards, ſtirre up your ſpirits, mend your pace, I will not bee put off as I have been; no more, ſuch loitering, and idling, and trifling, and halting, as hath been; I muſt have other manner of ſervice, other manner of praying, and hearing, and walking, and working, than hath been; be zealous, and amend, more labour, more care, more watchfulneſs, more activity, more of the Spirit, and Soul of what you profeſſe: When the Lord hath been thus goading, and ſpurring us on, and though our fleſh feels, yet our hearts will not feel, nor anſwer the Goad or Spur; Is this an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of tenderneſs?</p>
               <p>When great duties are little, and leſſer are none; when great ſins are infirmities, and little ones are nothing; when lying and defrauding, when falſe weights, and falſe wares, and falſe deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; when defaming, back-biting, tale-bearing, railing, reviling, do ſtand for little more than cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; when fellowſhip, and familiarity, with evil men in their ſins; when compliance with, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance at their wickedneſs; when ſinful courtings, and complementings of ſuch, to the fleſhing them, and hardning them in their waies, do paſs for vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and civilities; when frothy, vvanton diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,

and communication; vvhen ſcoffing and making a ſport at the ſins, or infirmities of others; vvhen ſinful vain jeſting, vvherein rather Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than wit muſt bee deny'd; when all theſe paſs for our ornaments, rather than our evils. Where's our tenderneſs?</p>
               <p>When upon the auditing of our accounts, the examining our books, and reckoning up our ſcores; where a talent is owing, wee bid conſcience take thy bill, and write down a ſhekel; where twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or an hundred ſins to be reckoned for, take thy bill, and write down ten or but one, and that a little one, when wee are ſo free in <hi>multiplying,</hi> and ſo falſe, in <hi>numbring</hi> our iniquities; where's our tenderneſs?</p>
               <p>Well Chriſtians, the Lord hath promiſed a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart, to make theſe ſtones fleſh; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing poſſibly is done already upon you, towards it; O let this ſad ſight now laid before you, this view of what's wanting, have ſome influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the making it up; let the ſenſe of <hi>no more done,</hi> work what is yet undone; as is ſaid before, let your unbrokenneſs break your hearts; let the ſtone that yet remains, make your fleſh to bleed.

               <p>In the opening of this love to God, wee ſhall conſider its

               <p n="1">1. Its Object. The Object of divine love is <hi>God.</hi> God is good, and good is amiable. God is <hi>all good, There is none good but one, that is God.</hi> God is <hi>eſſentially</hi> good, goodneſs in the abſtract; hee is infinitely excellent, hee is all perfection. In this one Attribute, all the reſt of the Attributes of God are included, and this in each of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Scriptures, ſpeaking to our capacities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe God and his glorious Attributes, in ſeveral and diſtinct notions; yet in each one all are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; each one is infinite, and infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is eſſentially all perfection. God is <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> good; the fountain and pattern, of all that moral good that is in the creatures; hee is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47970:88"/>
and gracious, ready to do them good; and hee is the felicitating end, or the bleſſedneſs of the ſoul. The goodneſs of God to his creatures, according to its different reſpects to them, hath its different and various appellations. As it is freely beſtow'd, 'tis Grace: As it reſpect them as <hi>needy,</hi> ſo 'tis <hi>Bounty:</hi> as in miſery, ſo 'tis <hi>mercy</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; as <hi>Provoking,</hi> ſo 'tis <hi>Patience:</hi> as it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends their good,</hi> ſo 'tis <hi>love:</hi> as it anſwers both their neceſſities and capacities, ſo 'tis <hi>Al-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> All theſe, his bounty, mercy, compaſſion, patience, love, al-ſufficiency: all theſe are in one word, his goodneſs, and goodneſs calls for love.

               <p>God himſelf is proportioned to us, conſider us as <hi>rational</hi> creatures, and in our ſtate of <hi>innocency;</hi> is both a ſufficient and a ſuitable good; but God in Chriſt onely, being conſidered as <hi>lapſed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> in a ſtate of ſin.</p>
               <p>God in Chriſt, is <hi>a God of pitty,</hi> and compaſſion to us; a God of patience, a God of mercy, with whom is plentious redemption. A God, pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning iniquity, and paſſing by tranſgreſſion; loving us in our low eſtate, loving us and pittying us, loving us and pardoning us; loving us and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, loving us and ſaving us from our ſins, and from the wrath to come. And ſuch love is the great flame that kindles love; love breaking forth out of a cloud of wrath, and fury, and diſpleaſure; abuſed love provoked love, and yet forgiving love; <hi>to whom much is forgiven, they will love much.</hi>

3. <hi>Propriety.</hi> What's good, good for us, and [our own] good, that carries our hearts. Wee moſt love our own good, becauſe wee moſt love our ſelves. Our love to God is heightened from our due ſelf-love; there is a <hi>ſinful</hi> ſelf-love; when either wee love that for a ſelf, which is not our ſelf; when wee love our fleſh and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſt; or when wee love our ſelves inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, more than God, and God only for our ſelves; and there is a <hi>lawful</hi> ſelf-love; when wee love our ſelves, <hi>in the Lord, and for the Lord.</hi> And the more wee thus love our ſelves, the more is the Lord loved by us; and the more hee is our own, the more love hee hath. Now in Chriſt the Lord is [our] God. Our own <hi>God; even our own God.</hi> Pſal. 67.6. <hi>O God thou art [my] God, and I will praiſe thee. Thou art my God and I will love thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord is God, and wee therefore love him; the Lord is good, gracious, merciful, and wee therefore love him, yea, and ought to love him, whether he bee ours or no; but when both meer, hee is God and our God; hee is good and our good; gracious, merciful, all-ſufficient, and all this to us; hence is our love made perfect in us.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Poſſeſſion;</hi> wee can love a diſtant, an abſent good. A good that's only poſſible; there's love in hope; but by how much the nearer good is to us, (that is really ſo) by ſo much the more attractive and acceptable 'tis. 'Tis then moſt in our hearts, when 'tis moſt in our hands. Indeed thoſe things which have only <hi>ſpeciem boni,</hi> that are <hi>fancied</hi> good; or thoſe things that are <hi>finite</hi> good; and good over-rated; that are judg'd better than they are, are lov'd moſt at a diſtance; becauſe when
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47970:90"/>
they come to hand, wee ſee our miſtake. But that which is what it ſeem'd; much more, that which is above our thoughts, beyond our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>infinite</hi> good; by how much the nearer, 'tis ever the dearer to us. All worldly good is moſt valued, (at leaſt by carnal hearts) at a diſtance; they promiſe themſelves more contentment in it, than it hath to pay them; their poſſeſſion is their diſappointment. Whileſt they luſted, they ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd, they ador'd; but when they have taſted, and eaten, it comes out at their noſtrils. Or elſe they ſit down, with the ſhame of the diſappointed; they are either ſurfeited, or hungry ſtill. <hi>Is this all? all you can do for mee? all the pleaſure, and comfort, I ſhall have of you? is all my expectation of delight, and ſatisfaction, come to no more but this?</hi> Miſerable comforters are you all! poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fruition is the proof of all things. And va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity proved, is the leſs loved. But God being an all-ſufficient, incomprehenſible good; by how much the nearer to us, by how much the more hee is ours by ſo much the more wee prize and love, becauſe now wee find (when wee have him, wee enjoy him) that before, <hi>the one half was not told us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in Chriſt, wee have not onely a propriety in God, but in ſome degree, a preſent poſſeſſion. <hi>Hee that hath the Son, [hath] the Father alſo.</hi> We ſee his light, wee feel his love, wee taſte of his goodneſs, wee enjoy his preſence, wee have God with us, wee have God in us, wee have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, he dwelleth in us, and wee in him, and hence wee love, and herein wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>

                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:47970:90"/>
3. <hi>God in all the things of God,</hi> in his Word, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Sabbaths, Saints, in graces, duties, in all his waies, the Saints love God, and love his word, 'tis God in the word they love; they love God, and they love Ordinances, and Sabbaths, and Saints; 'tis God in all theſe they love; They love the waies, and works, and all the diſpenſations of God, and 'tis God in them all they love, they ſee God in every thing, and they love God where ever they ſee him. They look on all theſe things with another eye, and therefore embrace them with another heart then other men.</p>
               <p>The Saints love to the things of God, is their love to God; for 'tis God in them (as was ſaid) that they love, their love to them is founded either on, their

               <p n="1">1. The things of God, are the <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> of God, as the Saints are born from above, ſo all the things of God, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

his Heavenly Kingdome, is divine, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and hee that loveth him that begets, therefore loveth thoſe which are begotten, and whatſoever proceedeth from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Word and the Saints are the <hi>Images</hi> of God, the character, and impreſſe of God are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; the Grace in the Saints, and the holy truths in the Word, are the very face of Chriſt; who is full of Grace and Truth, and this is their Rule, <hi>love God, and love his Image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The things of God are the <hi>Chariots</hi> of God. Hee that makes the Clouds his Chariots, makes alſo his Word, and his Ordinances, and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, his Chariots, wherein he rides down into theſe lower parts, to give the World a meeting. When Miniſters come, and the Word comes down, God comes down in them to viſit his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as 'twas ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi> So 'tis true of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> and all the diſpenſers of the Goſpel, they are <hi>choſen Veſſels to bear his Name,</hi> before the Sons of men; and as they are the Chariots in which God comes down, ſo are they alſo the <hi>Wagons</hi> which hee hath ſent them, to fetch them up to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; The Saints ſend up their hearts in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their hearts in their prayers, in their praiſes unto God. Old <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s heart leap'd, when hee ſaw the Wagons which <hi>Joſeph</hi> had ſent. Oh what love doth the Pſalmiſt expreſſe, to the Houſe and Courts of the Lord! <hi>O how amiable are thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, I was glad when they ſaid unto mee, let us go up into the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> Hee was glad to go thither, becauſe thence hee hoped to bee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried higher, from the Mountain to the Manſion; from Mount <hi>Zion</hi> here below, to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is above.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:47970:91"/>
It's the duty, and the delight of the Saints to bee aſcending Heaven-wards, they are <hi>dead</hi> with Chriſt, they are <hi>riſen</hi> with Chriſt; and 'tis not as they would with them, but when they are <hi>aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> up with Chriſt, they are dead with Chriſt, by <hi>repentance</hi> and humiliation, they are riſen with Chriſt, by <hi>faith</hi> and ſanctification, and they aſcend with Chriſt, by <hi>love</hi> and holy affection, this is their Chariot of fire, a Chariot, within a Chariot, that through Duties and Ordinances rides up in its own flames to the God of Love.</p>
               <p>Or if you will, the Ordinances of God, are our <hi>Jacobs Ladder</hi> reaching from Heaven to Earth; by which, Angels deſcend, and ſouls aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, God comes down, and hearts go up, praiſes go up, and bleſſings come down; thou haſt not prov'd what an Ordinance is, what Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er means, or Preaching means, or Sacraments mean, that haſt not ſeen God coming down, nor felt thine heart aſcending by them; hee that hath felt this, will ſay, here let mee dwell; let others bee where they will, amongſt their flocks, amongſt their herds, upon their beds, or at their cups, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their Harlots, or in their houſes; <hi>It is good for mee to bee here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No wonder Chriſtians, that carnal hearts are ſuch ſtrangers to the Word, can ſo well fit out at Duties, and can want Ordinances; Preaching and Praying, and Sabbaths, they can ſpare, and not feel their want, what wonder? What is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth? what is God to fleſh? theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots would carry them away from their Gods, carry them out of their own Country, into a ſtrange
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47970:92"/>
Land, where they have neither poſſeſſion nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; But oh! what a ſad wonder is it, that Saints ſhould go up ſo often into the Chariots, and yet be gotten no nearer home, that they ſhould be ſtill ſo much on the Earth, that have been ſo often mounted for Heaven; that thoſe hearts ſhould ſtill bee on the dunghils, whoſe feet are ſo often on the mountain of the Lord; that the Wagons ſhould bee ſo often ſent down, and go up empty; ſcarce an heart ſent up in them; yea, that they ſhould be ſo far from God, when God is among them. Where's your love, Chriſtians? how is it that it is ſtill below? what have you here? your City is above; your home is above; your God, your Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, your treaſure is above: oh how is it, that where your treaſure is, your hearts bee not alſo? hear from God, and not God with the meſſenger? ſend up to heaven, your eyes, your hands, your prayers, your complaints, your promiſes, and ſtill leave your hearts below? ſend up hearts to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and let them return again down to this earth? remain earth, and fleſh, and filth, and vanity, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo much converſe or pretence to it, with the holy God of ſpirits? loveſt thou God? when thou canſt ſo often go where hee is, and not care to ſee him? or if thou meet him, canſt let him go without a bleſſing? or if he bleſs thee, canſt go preſently and exchange thy Fathers bleſſing for a meſs of pottage? canſt loſe a duty in a dinner, the comforts and revivings of a Sermon, of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, of a Sabbath, in an hours carnal converſe in the world? did wee love our God more, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wee ſhould bee more with him, and to better purpoſe. His meetings would bee more
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47970:92"/>
precious, and the fruits of them more laſting. Wee ſhould neither go away without his bleſſing, nor throw it away when wee had gotten it.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the object of love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its Act. Love is a natural Affection. The love of God is the ſouls claſping or cloſing with the Lord. It is the expanſion, or going out of the heart, in its ſtrength, after God, the uniting or knitting of the ſoul vvith God, vvith a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and acquieſcence in him.</p>
               <p>There are three things included in this love.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The strength of the heart making out after God.</hi> This is that vvhich is commonly called our <hi>amor deſiderii,</hi> or our love of deſire, the breathing, or thirſting, or panting of the heart, after God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. The hearts vvorking God-vvards <hi>with its might;</hi> loving him above all things, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him above all things; and that both <hi>Intenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vè</hi> vvith the greateſt vigour and intention: and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daequatè</hi> as its compleat, and adequate object. God is its All. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The uniting of the ſoul with God.</hi> Our clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to him. By love heart cleaves to heart, ſoul cleaves to ſoul. Its ſaid of <hi>Shechem, Gen.</hi> 34.3. that his heart clave unto <hi>Dinah.</hi> Hee loved her vvith his heart, ſhee vvas gotten into his heart, and there his heart holds her. Acts 11.23. <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorts the Church, that <hi>with purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</hi> It is the <hi>knitting</hi> of the ſoul vvith God. Its ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>That the ſoul of</hi> Jonathan <hi>was knit with the ſoul of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>and</hi> Jonathan <hi>loved him as his own ſoul.</hi> And
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47970:93"/>
of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 44.30. to expreſs his tender love to <hi>Benjamin,</hi> 'tis ſaid, his life was bound up in the lads life. Of the multitude of believers wee read <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32. that they were all <hi>of one heart and of one ſoul.</hi> Their love had knit them up all into one. By love wee are one with God, and hee with us. It is the ſouls <hi>willing of God,</hi> as I may ſo ſpeak. Willing of God to it ſelf, and willing it ſelf, and all to God. All praiſes, all honour, all bleſſedneſs to him. Bee thou mine Lord, nothing leſs, nothing elſe. Bee thou mine, I need no leſs, I deſire no more. Let mee bee thine, be to thee, bee for thee, thy ſervant, thy ſacrifice, or what thou wilt, and <hi>let all mine</hi> bee thine; mine heart, and my hand, and my tongue, and my time, and mine intereſt. Let <hi>all thine</hi> bee to thee; thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and thy earth, with every perſon, with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature in them. Let every heart, every mouth, every limb, every creature, bee a praiſe to the Lord. <hi>Let the Lord live, and bleſſed bee my rock, let the God of my ſalvation bee exalted.</hi> Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knee bow, let every tongue confeſs unto God. This is the <hi>amor unionis,</hi> our love of union, as 'tis called. And 'tis the heart, the very eſſence of ſaving love; wherein are included both our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of God, and our ſurrender or reſignation of our ſelves unto God. <hi>Amor non eſt niſi donum amantis in amaetum.</hi> And our wiſhing and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all glory, dominion, and bleſſedneſs to him. And ſo here alſo is our <hi>amor benevolentiae,</hi> our love of benevolence. All theſe may bee inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that <hi>opening</hi> of the heart, mention'd, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. Its there ſaid, that the Lord opened <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>'s heart. The heart is then ſavingly opened,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47970:93"/>
when it freely lets out it ſelf upon God; all its ſtreams run in to the Lord; and when it takes in, and takes down, God into the depth of the ſoul. The heart thus opened to the Lord, when God is come in, will cloſe upon him. Abide with me; thou haſt entred upon thine habitation, oh let this bee thy dwelling for ever. Onely this muſt bee farther added, that with God it takes in all the things of God; his Word, his Ordinances, his waies, and all his diſpenſations. With his love his laws; with his comforts his counſels; with his counſels his corrections; with thee, I accept of all that's thine; both thy ſtaff and thy rod; both thy yoke and thy croſs; thy ſelf Lord, thy love Lord, and what thou wilt with thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſouls talking pleaſure, and taking up its reſt in him.</hi> This is call'd our <hi>Amor complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</hi> Where wee love there will bee a delightful <hi>ſtay or immoration</hi> of the mind upon God. <hi>Ubi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, ibi oculus.</hi> The object dwells in the eye; we are ſtill looking where we love. <hi>Anima eſt ubi amat.</hi> When I awake, I am ſtill with thee; there his thoughts are, of him is his meditation all the day long.</p>
               <p>My meditation of him ſhall bee ſweet. Hee that loves <hi>dwelleth in God. I will dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever.</hi> And why there? why there his God dwells, and therefore there his ſoul takes up its dwelling. There is alſo <hi>an acquieſcence</hi> of the heart in him. <hi>Return unto thy reſt, O my ſoul.</hi> But this is not felt, till love hath obtained. Till the ſoul feels it ſelf to love and to have what it loves; to love and to bee beloved; to accept and to bee accepted of God. When it comes to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47970:94"/>
this, then I have enough. <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine.</hi> And here is the ſweetneſs of Religion; the marrow and fatneſs of godlineſs, <hi>the pleaſure of love.</hi> When I love I can reſt; when I can reſt I can rejoyce; when I feel my ſelf to love, I know I am beloved, and then what is there wanting? where love is a ſtranger joy is not known; wee can never take comfort in any thing, but in that which wee love. When take wee pleaſure in eating, but when we have meat that wee love? what is a friend, or a wife, or a childe, when wee love them not? what is ſociety or communion, where love hath not firſt made an union? <hi>can two walk together except they bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed?</hi> with little comfort ſure; they would bee better pleaſed, were they parted aſunder. 'Tis love that is the pleaſure of our lives. 'Tis love that makes heaven ſweet; there wee ſhall have our fill of joy, becauſe there wee have our fill of love. Heaven would bee no heaven, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could not bee the <hi>joy,</hi> if hee were not the <hi>love</hi> of his Saints. What bitter draughts will love ſugar? ſin, and luſts, and all the filth of the fleſh, are ſweet morſels to carnal hearts; 'tis meat they love. God is nothing, Chriſt is nothing to them; <hi>What is thy beloved more than other beloveds?</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a bondage to them, holineſs a wearineſs; not the labours onely, but the joyes of the Saints, are empty and unſavoury things; <hi>there are no feaſts, but love-feaſts.</hi> Love is both the <hi>beſt diſh,</hi> and the <hi>onely ſauce</hi> to every diſh; 'tis the beſt diſh, he that feeds on divine love, will never complain of a ſhort meal; and 'tis the onely ſauce for every diſh, 'tis but unſavoury meat that is not ſeaſoned
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47970:94"/>
with love; wee may a little change the proverb, <hi>love is the beſt ſauce.</hi> Bee the meat never ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, it will not reliſh if it bee not loved. Love will make any thing down. When it puts ſuch a ſweetneſs into ſin, that even death, and hell will down with carnal hearts for its ſake, oh what a feaſt will love make of holineſs and glory? get love to Chriſt, love to Religion, and you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver demand, <hi>where is the bleſſedneſs?</hi> where is the ſweetneſs?</p>
               <p>Love will ſweeten, both the comforts, and the exerciſes of Religion; 'twill make duties ſweet, yea, and ſufferings ſweet. There are two things that are naturally ſweet to love.
<list>
                     <item>To pleaſe.</item>
                     <item>To praiſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He that loves will <hi>pleaſe,</hi> and obſerve whom hee loves. How careful are ſuch to watch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they grieve not their friend; what ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy does love put them upon, to find out what's grateful and acceptable. Acceptable looks, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable language, acceptable entertainment; what wilt thou Lord? what wilt thou have mee to bee? a ſervant? a door-keeper? a ſervant of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for thee? I will bee nothing but what thou wilt; any thing that thou wilt have mee. What wilt thou have mee to do, Lord! let mee know thy vvill, appoint mee my vvork. <hi>O that my waies were ſo directed, that I might keep thy ſtatutes.</hi> What vvilt thou have of mee? vvilt thou have mine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols! mine eaſe, or mine honour, or my pleaſure, or my houſe, or mine eſtate? vvilt thou have mine
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47970:95"/>
                  <hi>Iſaacks?</hi> is there any thing dearer to me than other, that might bee an offering to the Lord? wilt thou have my liberty, or my life! behold all is at thy feet; I can keep back nothing thou calleſt for.</p>
               <p>Hence love is ſaid to bee <hi>the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> There is in this good will, radically every good work. It would <hi>walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruitful in every good work.</hi> Love is <hi>generous;</hi> it would do great things, noble things; what ſhall I do for him, whom my ſoul honours! oh for a gift, that might bee worthy of him! but I have nothing; my goodneſs extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to thee; it would give more than it owes; but where it cannot do ſo, where it cannot bee <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,</hi> yet it would bee <hi>juſt;</hi> it would levell all accounts, and pay all debts; <hi>love would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love owing.</hi> It would give to all their due; it would not die in the debt of a ſervant, of a ſtranger, much leſs (could it help it) would it defaulk from the God of glory. That's the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge of love, <hi>pay what thou oweſt.</hi> Its receipts and returns, are a pleaſure to it; any thing that comes down from heaven, and every preſent it has to ſend thither, is a joy to love. This is the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that both ſpeak, <hi>happy ſoul, thou loveſt and art beloved.</hi> It catches at all opportunities, to ſend up meſſages of love, and knoweth no fitter meſſenger to ſend by, than by the hand of duty. Every duty is diſpatched with this ſuperſcription, <hi>the tribute of love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Love is the <hi>ſpring,</hi> that ſets all our wheels a going; the <hi>womb,</hi> in which all our works are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the <hi>fire</hi> in the heart, that vents it ſelf in our words and wayes. <hi>The fire kindled, then ſpake I
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47970:95"/>
with my tongue.</hi> Love is to a Saint, what <hi>malice</hi> is to Sathan; that which gives force to all his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Sathans temptations are called <hi>fiery darts;</hi> and this, not onely becauſe they are <hi>headed,</hi> and barbed with fire; as poyſoned arrows, they burn where they hit; they ſet ſin on fire, they ſet the ſoul on fire; burning with luſt, and wickedneſs. but becauſe they are <hi>winged</hi> with fire, and forced with fire; the bullet is <hi>fired</hi> out of the Gun, and thence it flies ſo fiercely. 'Tis the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans heart that fires out all his darts. What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice doth with Sathan, that doth love with Saints. It ſets the heart in a flame, of holy zeal, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity for God. Jer. 20.9. <hi>Thy word was in mee as fire,</hi> (it hath kindled a fire there) <hi>I was weary with forbearing.</hi> An heart of love is weary, but not of <hi>action,</hi> but of <hi>idleneſs. Weary with forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> not with doing; never weary of doing much, ever weary of doing nothing. <hi>O God my heart is fixed, my heart is fixed;</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will ſing and give thanks.</hi> Love will adde, O God, mine heart is <hi>fiered,</hi> my heart is fiered; there's a flame kindled; mine heart burneth, in holy deſires, and zeal for thee; and where love hath ſet the heart a <hi>burning,</hi> the heart will ſet the hand a <hi>working,</hi> and the feet a <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He that loves will <hi>praiſe</hi> whom he loves. Praiſe is comely, and praiſe is a pleaſure to the upright in heart. 'Tis the delight of love to be ſpeaking of the perfections, of the vertues, of the beauties, of the excellencies of her beloved. The Spouſe in the book of Canticles whoſe whole language is all love, her heart is ſo full, that her lips overflow
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47970:96"/>
with the mention of the excellencies of Chriſt. <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt amongſt ten thouſand.</hi> His head fine gold, his eyes Dove's eyes, his cheeks a bed of ſpices, his lips are lillies, his hands are gold-rings, his legs pillars of marble, his countenance excellent, his mouth ſweet, yea, hee is altogether lovely; this is my beloved, and this is my friend, O Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem. Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders? Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed, in the City of our God. Thy mercy O Lord, is in the heavens, thy faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs reacheth unto the clouds. Thy righteouſneſs is like the great mountains, thy judgments are a great deep. How excellent is thy loving kindneſs, O Lord, therefore the ſons of men put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings. I will ſpeak of the glorious honour of thy Majeſty, and of thy wondrous works; the Lord is gracious and full of compaſſion, ſlow to anger, and of great mercy. The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. Let all thy works praiſe thee, O Lord let thy Saints bleſs thee; let them ſpeak of the glory of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and talk of thy power. Let them abundantly utter the memory of thy goodneſs, and ſing of thy righteouſneſs.</hi> O my God, thou art all love, all goodneſs, all grace, all glory; O let thy ſervant bee all praiſe. Let this heart bee an <hi>altar,</hi> and every ſervice a <hi>ſacrifice;</hi> let this mouth bee a trumpet, and every word a <hi>Pſalm;</hi> let my breath bee as <hi>incenſe,</hi> and every member a <hi>cenſer.</hi> Let all that is within mee, my ſoul with all its powers; let all that is without me, my body with all its members, ſhout for joy, and ſing forth the high
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47970:96"/>
praiſes of God. This is the voice of Love.</p>
               <p>And now you have another excellency of the new heart, laid open to your view: <hi>Love;</hi> An heart to love.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, prize this precious grace; prize it, and you will write down, this word alſo, among the great and precious Promiſes; and if you would prize it aright, take your eſtimate of it, from its <hi>worth,</hi> and its <hi>want;</hi> as we uſe to prize Jewels, from their
<list>
                     <item>excellencie,</item>
                     <item>rarity.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Prize it, according to its <hi>worth, and excellency.</hi> Why, what is the worth? Cant. 8.7. <hi>If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, it would bee contemned.</hi> The whole world is not of that value, to bee a price for love; no it muſt come by gift, it's not to bee bought for money, love is worth as much as <hi>a ſoul,</hi> and that's more than all the world. <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, to win the whole World, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> love is as much worth as <hi>all Religion;</hi> 'tis the ſoul and the ſubſtance of <hi>all Religion;</hi> all the Graces, the Duties and Exerciſes of it, are onely valued, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the love that is in them; what is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, hope, patience without love? what is prayer, faſting, alms, without charity? They are worth nothing, ſhall I ſay? nay they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; If I had all knowledge, and all faith, and were all prayer, and all labour, and all ſuffering; and had not charity, I were nothing. Love is worth as much <hi>as Heaven</hi> is worth, as <hi>Christ,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> is worth to us. God is love, and God is not,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47970:97"/>
if love bee not in us. Doſt thou prize thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? Is thy houſe, or thy mony, or thy lands, any thing to thee? Doſt thou value thy ſoul? Is Religion, is Heaven, is Chriſt, is God himſelf of any account with thee? Then prize the love of God; Without love, God is no God to thee, Chriſt is no Chriſt to thee, Heaven is no Heaven for thee; better thou hadſt no ſoul, no being than no love. O prize the Love of God; prize and ſeek, prize and pray, pray as for thy life, as for thy ſoul, as for thy everlaſting Kingdome; <hi>Lord let mee love thee;</hi> Get love, and get all, love and thou wilt bee holy, love and thou wilt be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, love and thou wilt bee fruitful, love, and thou wilt pleaſe, praiſe, and enjoy thy God, love and thou wilt fear, ſerve, ſuffer, and die for him, love, and thou ſhalt live; prize love, prize it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its worth.

Oh! we freeze in our Duties, we freeze in our Devotions, wee are almoſt frozen out of them all; if vvee have a Sacrifice left, vvhat fire is there to offer it up? <hi>The God that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth by fire, let him bee God,</hi> ſaid <hi>Elijah:</hi> the heart that <hi>asketh</hi> by fire, that aſcendeth in fire, let that bee the heart for God: <hi>Behold the wood, and the fire, but where is the Lamb for the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?</hi>

Wee may ſay behold the wood and the ſacrifice, but where is the Fire to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it up? our Spirits have taken a cold, the chill of them appears in all our duties. <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi where dwelleſt thou?</hi> Love where dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thou? Zeal of God, where is thy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode? how many houſes muſt wee ſearch? how many hearts muſt wee walk through, e're wee finde thine Habitation? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells the <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom. 10.2. <hi>that they have a Zeal of God, but not according to Knowledge;</hi> wee have the Knowledge of God, but oh! where is the Zeal? <hi>the Zeal of thine houſe,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>hath eaten mee up;</hi> but is not that eater eaten? The houſe hath burnt up the fire, or if there be any fire left, is it not ſtrange fire? not the fire of Love, but of Luſt, of Pride, or Covetouſneſs; or that wilde fire of envy, and contention, that heats our ſpirits? <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> was all on fire againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab; Come ſee my zeal for the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> That fire was fury, not love; or if 'twas love, 'twas ſelf-love, not the love of God, that made all that flame; ſuch hearts are like the evil tongue, James 3. <hi>ſet on fire of Hell.</hi> Such heats are not from above, but are earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh; wee freeze ſtill, while wee thus fry; our <hi>praeter</hi>-natural
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47970:98"/>
heats have extinguiſhed the <hi>ſuper</hi>-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
               <p>O! how little <hi>kindly warmth</hi> do wee find in our ſpirits? do wee feel our hearts work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upwards, aſcending in our flames? wee all pretend to love, but conſider, are our hearts making out in their ſtrength af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God? Wee wiſh well to his Name and Intereſt, wee wiſh hee were ours, wee wiſh our ſelves his; O if wiſhing were lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! what Chriſtians ſhould wee be? But doth the Kingdom of God ſuffer violence? who are they that ſo run, as if they would take God by force, take Heaven by force? The Kingdome of Heaven may offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence if it will, and take us by force; but how little violence doth it ſuffer? We ſay wee love God, but is there not ſomething elſe wee love more? wee deſire to be holy, but is there not ſomething elſe wee deſire more?</p>
               <p>Oh how few hearty friends hath Chriſt in the world? and how little love from theſe few? ſo little, that we cannot tell our ſelves, whether it be any thing or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; how hard are we put to it? what a narrow ſearch muſt we make? how many arguments muſt wee conſult? how many marks muſt we conſider, e're we can prove
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47970:98"/>
we love him? and yet at laſt, are ſtill in doubt, whether we love him or not.</p>
               <p>When we love our carnal Friends, our Wives, our Children, we can feel that we love them; when we love our Eaſe, or our Eſtates, or our Liberties, we can feel that we love them; but our God we cannot tell whether we love him or no; How few of us can boldly make our appeal to him, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! how many wounds doth Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the houſe of his Friends? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſleights muſt hee put up? how often when hee hath ſate down, in his own, (in the higheſt) room, have we ſaid, to him <hi>give this man place,</hi> give this friend or this buſineſs place; and ſo made him take the lower room. How hath hee when he hath come to our doors (his love hath often brought him thither) how often hath hee ſtood, and knock'd and call'd, <hi>open to mee my Love, my Sister;</hi> and there been made to ſtand, and wait, when ſtrangers have been gotten in, and taken up all the rooms? The world can never come out of ſeaſon, but Chriſt is fain to wait his ſeaſons, when he can finde us at leiſure; if there bee any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gueſt with us, our Lord muſt wait; <hi>Go thy way for this time, when I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

I charge you, O Daughters, that you ſtirre not, that you diſturb not my Beloved, and my Soul; more love would command their attendance, upon the work of the Lord, would gird up the loins of the mind, and gather in all its ſcattered Meſſengers; come all yee powers of my ſoul, come and do your homage, come and help in the ſervice of my God.</p>
               <p>Oh! at what diſtance are wee content
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47970:99"/>
to live from the Lord, ſometimes for many daies together? Our ſouls and our God are grown ſtrange, and yet wee can bee merry, and quiet; wee can bee without the preſence of God, and yet never miſs it: not a ſmile from his face, nor a look of love from us to him, and yet no trouble fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; the Sun may bee Ecclipſed, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Cloud, and yet no darkneſs upon our Spirits: wee do not walk in darkneſs, when wee have no light, ſorrow and ſadneſs is as far from us, as God is from us; we can warm our ſelves at our own fires, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the light of our own ſparks, as if theſe were the Sun; wee can do as well in a Miſt, as in the Sun-ſhine, day and night are both alike to us; The Children of the Bride-chamber do not Faſt, but can Feaſt, and make merry, when the Bridegroom is taken from them; their carnal content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they can make a ſhift with, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the room of their Lord. Can wee not ſometimes go where our Lord feeds, and never finde him; go to pray, or go to hear, or go to a Sacrament, and the Lord never meet us there, and yet can return well enough ſatisfied? When wee thus want communion with God, and [can] want it; where's our love, what love
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47970:100"/>
is that? which can ſo well bear the abſence of her Beloved? Call mee no more <hi>Naomi,</hi> pleaſant; but call mee <hi>Marah,</hi> bitter; <hi>I went out full, but I return empty;</hi> Full of Grace, full of Joy, becauſe full of the Lord; but behold all is gone, my Husband is loſt, my God is departed from mee: Call mee no more <hi>Naomi,</hi> but call mee <hi>Marah,</hi> for the Almighty hath dealt bitterly with me, hath hid his face from me, for theſe things I weep, mine eyes, mine eyes run down with tears, becauſe the Comforter that ſhould relieve my ſoul, is farre from mee; ſuch are the tears of Love, for her abſent Lord.</p>
               <p>Oh! how little Conſcience is there made of beſtowing that on the Lord, which wee have beſtowed on him; wee give and take, wee pretend to have given all to God; but are wee not often taking away, what wee have given, and beſtowing it elſewhere? Love would have all we have running into God, and would have nothing run beſides; but Oh! what waſte is there made? of our time, of our parts, and other Talents, which were they well husbanded, would come to much, and bee given to the Lord? when ſo many daies, and hours run out, and no account taken of them, on what, or on
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47970:100"/>
whom, they are conſumed; when our eyes, and our ears, and hands, and tongues, which were made for God; the Devil, and Luſt, muſt ſo often have the uſing of them; when back and belly, and friends and companions, muſt carry away, what ſhould bee ſpent on God and Souls; when what ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for Religion, and Charity to have the ſpending of, muſt bee at the diſpoſure of Pride, Prodigality, and Gluttony; when our Prayers, our Faſting, our Preaching, and hearing; all our Duties muſt become ſacrifices to our Luſt, our Idols are ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to devour the Sacrifices of the Lord; when our pride and fleſhly ends, muſt have the offering, and the eating of our Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; this muſt make our Prayers, and preach our Sermons, and keep our Faſts, and give our Almes, and wear the credit, and honour of them, as its own Crown; when God is thus robbed, and wee let the thief run away with all, and is never purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or queſtioned, Oh! where is our love?</p>
               <p>Oh! how little pleaſure do wee take in the Lord? what a wearineſs is it to us, to wait upon him? how glad are wee, when wee come [back] from the Houſe of the Lord? when wee come off our Knees, come out of our Cloſets, when
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47970:101"/>
the Sabbaths are gone, and the new-Moons are over, and wee make our returns from Heaven to Earth? How much work have wee, to keep our hearts by the Lord? how do they ſlink away e're wee are aware? and whilſt wee are in his Preſence, how ſeldome do wee rejoyce in his Preſence? What hungry meals, what jejune feaſts do wee make before the Lord? Wee reliſh not his Daintys, his Wine is but lees, his Marrow and his fat things, are but leanneſs to our Souls; a little love would ſweeten every drop, would ſeaſon every morſel, that comes from his Table; would make our very Faſts to bee pleaſant bread: Wee feed upon the diſh, or the trencher, and not the meat; on the bone, and not the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; Ordinances, and the external Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Religion, are but the bone, or the ſhell, or the diſh, it is God that is the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, the Marrow and Fatneſs. How little Communion have wee with the Lord, in our approaches to him, and how little ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do wee finde in the little wee have? Communion is the pleaſure of Love, and Love is the ſweetneſs of Communion; Now I am where I would bee; O! how amiable are thy Tabernacles? very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant art thou to mee O Lord; that is the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47970:101"/>
voice of Love. Had wee more love, wee ſhould bee more ſpiritual; and ſpiritual things, would bee more grateful to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual hearts; Divine Love, is like the fire, it rarifies, and changes hearts into its own likeneſs, and then there's ſweetneſs; O we are carnal, and that's enough to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that there's little of the love of God abiding in us.</p>
               <p>Conſider theſe things, and you will ſee that love is a rarity; there's but little true love in the world; O prize the love of God; let its want make it prized; ſhall it bee ſo <hi>rare,</hi> and yet ſo cheap? prize it, and preſs on after it.</p>
               <p>What do theſe hearts below? are they not ſtill below? ſo cold, ſuch clods of clay, and yet above? ſo carnal, ſo ſenſual and yet in Heaven? ſo hungry, and ſo greedy in ſucking the juice of this earth, in taking in its pleaſures; ſo buſy in digging out the Wealth of the earth, and ſearching for its treaſures; [hearts] ſo buſy this way, and yet not here? how canſt thou ſay, I am walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the God of Glory, when thou art ſtill worſhipping the Gods of the Earth? how canſt thou ſay, this heart <hi>is riſen, it is not here;</hi> when it may bee ſaid to thee, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the place where it lyes;</hi> it is ſtill in the

field, in the ridges and furrows thereof; it is ſtill in the Mines, in the heart of the earth, ſee the place where it lyes; we ſow our hearts with our ſeed, we ſend them down to dig in the heart of the Earth.</p>
               <p>But what do theſe hearts below? <hi>ſurſum corda,</hi> get you up, get you up; leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Mantle here, your carkaſſes; Earth to Earth, Duſt to Duſt. Come heave theſe ſouls Heaven-ward; let them take the wing and be gone; O that I had the wings of a Dove, that I might fly up, and be at reſt; Be lower than ever by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but let love be on high.</p>
               <p>Behold thoſe <hi>cords of love,</hi> that are let down in every Ordinance, in every Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; there's a cord let down to gather up hearts; hearken to thoſe <hi>calls of love,</hi> come up hither, come up hither; we come Lord; thou bid'ſt us come, O lend us thy hand, and lift us up.</p>
               <p>Come on Chriſtians, come let's be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if wee love wee are happy; Come let's rejoyce, if wee love wee joy; come let's live, wee dye, wee dye; while wee linger on this earth, if wee love, wee live; let's live, and let our life bee love; let our works bee, <hi>labours of love,</hi> our ſufferings <hi>ſeals of love,</hi> our ſorrows, the <hi>ſorrows of love,</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:47970:102"/>
our wounds, <hi>loves ſcars,</hi> our prayers the <hi>cryes of love,</hi> our praiſes, <hi>love ſongs,</hi> to our Lord and God. Let every duty, every exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, let every member, every power, let our bodies, let our ſouls, bee loves Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; as we ſee in all his, ſo let the Lord ſee love in all our waies.</p>
               <p>Canſt thou not love? look till thou canſt, look up to thy God, ſend up thy thoughts thither; let thy Meditations bee of him, theſe will not bee long before the Throne, e're they fetch up thy heart; Look on thy Jeſus, behold his hands and his feet; come and put thy finger into the print of the Nails, and thruſt thine heart into his ſide; and there let it lie, till thou feel it warm; Look up to thy Jeſus, lift up a prayer, Lord let mee love thee; if thou loveſt let mee love thee; I will ſeek till I can ſee, let mee ſee till I can love. What have I here Lord? my all is with thee, my help, my hope, my treaſure, my life is hid with Chriſt in God. And yet behold this all is nothing to mee, while mine heart is no more with thee, take it Lord, take it up; where my treaſure is, there let mine heart bee alſo.</p>
               <p>Doubting Chriſtian, who becauſe thou loveſt ſo little, feareſt thou loveſt not at
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47970:103"/>
all; cry for more, but bee thankful for what thou haſt; bee <hi>aſhamed</hi> thou loveſt no more, but bee not <hi>diſmayed,</hi> thou complaineſt thou canſt not love God; but doſt thou love his Image? his Saints, his Word, his Works, his Waies? Whilſt thou ſayeſt thou loveſt not God, doſt thou love Godlineſs; if thou canſt not love, can'ſt grieve, can'ſt lament after him? haſt thou choſen, doſt thou hang upon, truſt in the Lord? If thou canſt not love, can'ſt fear and follow the Lord? If he be not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in thy affection, is he in thy thoughts, in thy mouth, in thine eye? Is hee thy aim, and thy ſcope? doth thy courſe bend towards him? Comfort thine heart in theſe things, thou mayeſt ſee, though thou canſt not feel thou loveſt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AN heart to fear the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> I ſhall proceed to the opening of this by theſe ſteps; I ſhall ſhew 1. That the Lord God is a dreadful God. 2. That the Lord hath put the dread of himſelf upon the hearts of all the earth. 3. That yet by ſin the heart of man is much hardned from the fear of the Lord. 4. That God will recover his Honour, and again put his fear into the hearts of his people. 5. What this fear of the Lord is, that he will put into them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord God, is a dreadfull God; he is dreadfull in the Excellency and Glory of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, <hi>Job</hi> 13.11. <hi>Shall not his Excellency make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you?</hi> His Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is dreadfull. <hi>Fear ye not me, ſaith the Lord? Will ye not tremble at my preſence? Which have placed the ſand for the bound of the Sea by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall decree, that it cannot paſs it, and though the Waves thereof toſs themſelves, yet they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; though they roar, yet can they not paſs over it.</hi> Fear ye not me, ſaith the Lord? He that did this, what can he not do? His wrath is a dread, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.10. <hi>At his wrath, the earth ſhall tremble, and the nations ſhall not be able to abide his indignation.</hi> Yea, his Holineſs, his Truth, his Righteouſneſs, and all his Name, <hi>Deut,</hi> 28.58. <hi>That thou mayeſt
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47970:104"/>
fear this glorious and fearfull Name (the Lord thy God.)</hi> The Lord God is a dreadful God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord God hath put the dread of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the hearts of all the earth. Not the beſt onely, but the worſt of the ſons of men. <hi>I am a great King, ſaith the Lord, and my Name is dreadful among the Heathen.</hi> This dread of the Lord breaks forth upon them,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>impreſs of God</hi> upon the natures of all men. As the Law, ſo the being of God is written in their hearts, he hath his witneſs in their Conſciences. If the Atheiſts of the Earth could anſwer all the Arguments from without, proving that there is a God, yet they can never confute their own Conſciences. If the works of God do not, their Reins ſhall inſtruct them; If they will not ſee, whether they will or no they ſhall feel that there is a God; and where ever God is felt, he is feared: Even when their mouth ſpeaketh proud things, their heart ſhall meditate terror; and when nothing elſe is, they ſhall be a terror to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is increaſed by the <hi>great works of God,</hi> his Wonders that he doth in the world; his Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and his Hail, his Wind, and his Waves, and his Earth-quakes, make an Earth-quake in hearts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its further heightned, <hi>by his Judgments</hi> which he executeth on the Earth. The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, are God revealing himſelf from Heaven, againſt the ungodlineſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men; and do then ſtrike moſt terror, 1. When he ſmites <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> and makes quick work with ſinners: as when <hi>Herod</hi> was ſmote
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47970:104"/>
by an Angel of God, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by fire from God, immediately upon their ſin. Sudden ſtrokes ſhake ſecure hearts. 2. When he executes <hi>ſtrange</hi> judgments, makes a new thing, as in the caſe of <hi>Korah</hi> and his company, he made the Earth to open her mouth upon them and ſwallow them up; ſo he made the flies, and the froggs, and the lice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his Wrath on <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> 3. When he executes <hi>great Wrath for little Sins,</hi> as men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them; as in the caſe of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> whom he ſtruck dead, for but touching the Ark when it ſhook. 4. When he exerciſes <hi>great ſeverity on his own;</hi> on thoſe that are near him. If he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not his Sons, what will he do with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? <hi>If theſe things be done on the green Tree, what ſhall be done on the dry?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet further, By their <hi>Conſcience of guilt,</hi> and their binding over to the judgment to come. <hi>The ſin of Judah is written with a Pen of Iron, with the point of a Diamond, it is graven upon the tables of their heart.</hi> The ſin of <hi>[Judah]</hi> is written; yea, and the ſin of the <hi>Gentile</hi> alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing.</hi> And where their <hi>ſin</hi> is written, there their <hi>judgment</hi> is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; which even nature it ſelf will teach, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably follow upon ſin: and this is the great dread that is upon them. The very mention of judgment to come, made a <hi>Felix</hi> tremble, at the face of a poor Priſoner. This is the terror of the Lord, mentioned by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10,11. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment-ſeat.—Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47970:105"/>
perſwade men.</hi> Death is ſaid to be <hi>the King of terrors;</hi> and this is the terror of death, <hi>after that the judgment.</hi> All theſe, the impreſs of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts; the wonders of God in the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d; the vengeance of God executed on ſin; the ſence of gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, and of a judgment to come, do preach to the Conſciences of ſinners, that <hi>It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet by ſin the heart of man is much <hi>hardned from the fear of the Lord.</hi> Sin blinds the eye, and hardens the heart; brings into danger, and puts out of fear. Who in ſuch danger, and yet who ſo bold as the blind ſinner? When the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is darkned, the next word we read is, <hi>Paſt feeling, Eph.</hi> 4.19. There is included in the very nature of ſin, a ſlighting of God; and by once ſlighting, we learn to ſlight him more. Slight the Command, and you will quickly ſlight the Curſe: Laugh at duty, and 't will not be long ere you laugh at tear: And when <hi>ſin</hi> hath thus hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, God will alſo harden; lets the ſinner alone, ſuſpends his judgments, ſmites the ſinner with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial blindneſs, and gives him up to a <hi>Reprobate mind, Rom.</hi> 1.28. And when once they come to this, then Hell is broke looſe: For what follows? <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>Being filled with all unrighteouſneſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, wickedneſs, covetouſneſs, malitiouſneſs, and what not?</hi> Pſal. 36.1. <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, there is no fear of God before his eyes. Gen,</hi> 20 When <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſuch a thought, <hi>Surely the fear of God is not in this place,</hi> what thought he was there then? Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Adultery, Rapes, all manner of villany.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47970:105"/>
                  <hi>What ſaweſt thou amongſt us, that thou haſt done this thing?</hi> What hurt, what evill didſt thou ſee among us? What evill? Evill enough, to make me afraid; I thought the fear of God was not here, and there needs no more to make me afraid. Say of any Perſon, <hi>The fear of God is not in this man,</hi> and you therein ſay, <hi>The Devil is in him,</hi> here dwels ſin, and all manner of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Say of any place, <hi>The fear of God is not in this place,</hi> and if you find it an <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Sodom</hi> for abominations, you will not wonder. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.9. <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean.</hi> That is, not only <hi>Formaliter,</hi> but <hi>Effectivè,</hi> it cleanſeth. Where this is not, every unclean thing may dwell. The reaſon why this world is ſuch a world as 'tis, ſuch a wicked world, ſuch a treacherous, deceitful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly world; why there is ſo little Faith, or Truth, or Mercy, or Charity, or Sobriety, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſo little of the fear of God. Sin hath caſt out fear, and this hath brought forth ſin in abundance. The Law is nothing, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are nothing, Conſcience is nothing, God is nothing to men, becauſe he is not their fear. Wickedneſs is as righteouſneſs, villany as honeſty; prodigality, debauchery, as temperance and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety; yea, and hath gotten the ſtart of it; it faceth the Sun, it lifts up the head, it wears the Garland; it paints it ſelf Vertue, Generoſity, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, the beauty and ornament of the World, where the fear of God is departed.</p>
               <p>God may promiſe, threaten, command; <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to my voice, turn at my reproofs, caſt away your tranſgreſſions:</hi> Awake from your wine, be chaſte, ſober, be humble; let your merriment be turned

into mourning, your jollity into heavineſs. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your Creator, remember your ſouls, why will you die? Turn and live: God may ſpeak thus, once, and twice, and ten times, but is not regarded; his words have no weight, his counſels have no credit, his warnings are of no value with hardned fearleſs hearts.

               <p n="1">1. A Reverence of God. To fear God, is to have the awe of God abiding upon the heart, to be under a ſence of the Majeſty and Glory of the Lord, ſhining forth in all his Attributes, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Holineſs and Omniſcience; the glory of his Holineſs, and the ſence of ſuch an holy eye upon the ſoul, ſtrikes it with dread and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. This is expreſt in Scripture by <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lord</hi> in the heart, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. <hi>I will be ſanctified in them that draw nigh me. Iſa.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi> There is mention in Scripture of a <hi>ſanctifying of God,</hi> and a <hi>juſtifying of God:</hi> As God doth juſtifie, and ſanctifie his people, ſo they are to juſtifie and ſanctifie God. Theſe two, the juſtifying and ſanctifying of God, though they be much the ſame, yet there is ſome difference betwixt them: To ſanctifie God, is to reverence him in our hearts, and to repreſent him in the glory of his Holineſs before men. To juſtifie God, ſuppoſeth a ſinful judging, and fooliſh charging of God, in the hearts of men, and is our vindicating of him from ſuch charges. Is God righteous! How is it then that he is ſo partial in his dealings with the righteous and unrighteous? that he deals worſe with thoſe that fear him, then with thoſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47970:107"/>
that fear him not? Is God good? How is it then that he is ſo hard, not onely in impoſing, but inflicting ſuch hard things upon his own? Is God true? How is it then that he fails his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo often, when he hath ſaid, I will never fail them nor forſake them? Our fleſh hath failed, and our heart hath failed, yea and our God hath often failed us too; we have often called, and have had no anſwer; we have often truſted, and have had no deliverer. Yet God is righteous, yet God is good, yet God is true; he hath not been unrighteous, he hath not been an hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he hath not failed nor forſaken; this is to juſtifie God.</p>
               <p>Our juſtifying of God, hath ſome kindes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with Gods juſtifying of us. Gods juſtification of us, ſtands in his not imputing ſin to us, and accepting us as righteous; and our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of God, ſtands in our not imputing evill to him, and our acknowledging him to be true, juſt, and good. God hath juſtified me from my ſins, and thats enough to proclaim him good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, whatever his other dealings be: Let him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me, let him chaſtiſe me, ſince he will not judge me nor condemn me with the world. God hath juſtified himſelf in my Conſcience. I have found that the Lord is gracious, I have found that God is faithfull; he hath ſaid he will not, and I muſt ſay, he hath not forſaken! He hath not failed, when he hath moſt failed me; when he hath been fartheſt off from my help, he hath even then been a preſent help in trouble: He hath anſwered, when he hath been moſt ſilent; he hath been moſt good, when he hath been moſt hard;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47970:107"/>
I have never found more ſweet, then in his bitter Cup; I muſt judge my ſelf, not my God: I have ſinned, I have ſinned againſt him, and therefore I muſt juſtifie him when he ſpeaketh, and clear him when he judgeth. Hold thy peace queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous heart, be ſilent all the Earth before the Lord, for <hi>truly God is good to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and to them that are of a clean heart.</hi> There be few among the worſt of <hi>ſinners,</hi> but if Conſcience might be ſuffered to ſpeak, it would juſtifie God. 'Tis Luſt that quarrels, not Conſcience: 'Tis vain to ſerve the Lord, and what profit is there to keep his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His waies are unequal and hard, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe failes, take one time with another, oftner then 'tis made good.

This they may thank God for, and their following of him. 'Tis better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſervant of ſin, then the ſervant of Chriſt. Thus <hi>Luſt</hi> blaſphemes; but ſpeak <hi>Conſcience;</hi> Is God unrighteous? Is God falſe of his word? Are the pleaſures of ſin better then the gain of godlineſs? Have the children of this world made a wiſer choiſe then the children of light? Speak ſinner, let thy Conſcience ſpeak whether it be thus or no. God hath not left himſelf without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the hearts of ſinners; much more will his Saints, when they do ſpeak their hearts, ſpeak good of his name. But this by the way.</p>

To return to the matter in hand. To ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God, is eſpecially to reverence him in the heart; to have ſuch an high, an holy, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſteem of him, as commands an awe upon the heart; and that</p>

[Be thou in the fear of the Lord.] 'Tis not only, Let the fear of the Lord be in thee, habitually in thy heart, but actuate and ſtir up this holy fear, keep up an holy awe, a deep ſence of God alwaies upon thee; let the fear of the Lord be before thine eyes; be poſſeſſed and ſwallowed up of this fear [all the day long] where ever thou art, with whomſoever thou haſt to do, remember thou haſt ſtill to do with God. A Chriſtian ſhould ſtand alwaies <hi>pro tribunali;</hi> every day ſhould be as the laſt day, the day of judgment to him. <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as thoſe that ſhall be judged, Jam.</hi> 2.12. The Judge ſtands at the door, yea, and thou mayeſt ſee him through every window, yea through every wall; every wall is a window, through which God may ſee and be ſeen. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian (when he is as he ſhould be) cannot wink God out of ſight; can look no where, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds that eye that ſtrikes an awe upon his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>This abiding reverence of God, what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence will it have upon the whole courſe; we ſhall then ſerve God <hi>acceptably;</hi> when we fear, we ſhall pleaſe God; <hi>That we may ſerve God (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably) with reverence and godly fear.</hi> We ſhall then ſerve God <hi>univerſally</hi> in every thing.

We ſhall then walk before the Lord <hi>ſteadily;</hi> When we fear, we ſhall fix, and hold in an even frame and courſe. Fear will be our Ballaſt, whileſt Love fills our Sails, Fear will Ballaſt our Veſſell. How are ſlight and frothy ſpirits toſſed up and down? Whither do they wander? How many hearts, and faces, and frames have they every day? What contradictions are they to themſelves? The reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God upon them, would fix them, and hold them in a more even and equal poiſe. We ſhould then ſerve the Lord more <hi>Honourably;</hi> When we fear, we ſhall ſhew forth the vertues of God before the world; ſo much of the reverence, ſo much of the holineſs of God upon us, The preſence of a Chriſtian walking in the fear of the Lord, is as the preſence of God; the reverence of God upon his heart, caſts a beam of Divine Majeſty into his face, and oftentimes begets an awe and reverence of him in the hearts of the worſt of ſinners; they reverence, even whileſt they revile and perſecute him,</p>

               <p>Sin is the <hi>inſurrection</hi> and rebellion of the heart againſt God; it turns from him, and turns againſt him, it runs over to the camp of the enemy, and there takes up arms againſt God. Sin is a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from God, and a fighting againſt God: it would ſpoil the Lord of all the Jewels of his Crown. It oppoſeth the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of God: A ſinfull heart would ſet up it ſelf in Gods Throne,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47970:110"/>
it would be King in his ſtead, and have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of all.

Sin will be the wrong of God, and the loſs of God; it may be a total and eternal loſs for ought he knows, at leaſt if not aſſured: God loſt, is the ſoul loſt, the Kingdom loſt; this is Hell, the loſs of God. Better have no being, better be a Dog, or Toad, then a man without a God: or if he be not utterly loſt, yet to his preſent ſence 'twill be all one as if he had no God: his peace is loſt, his comfort is loſt, and his ſoul is often given for

loſt, from whom God is departed, though but for a ſeaſon; he can take pleaſure in nothing, he can find reſt no where, whoſe God is out of fight. He knows not what a God means, who can ſpare him till Death or Judgment. A Chriſtian cannot live a day without him; 'tis night, 'tis all dark, he knows no day while the Sun is ſet upon him.

Oh I was wont to meet with God here, theſe glaſſes were my Windows into Heaven; and then how pleaſant were they to me?

               <p>Chriſtians, Let none ſay, this fear is not the fear of his Children; this be to his Enemies and Slaves, not his Children; Fear ye not their fear. But are not all theſe things written for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Is this written onely for their ſakes? Or ſaith he not alſo for our ſakes? For our ſakes no doubt this is written ſaith the Apoſtle in another caſe. Conſider that full Scripture to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. to the end of <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Now theſe things were our examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted; Neither be ye Idolaters as were ſome of them; as it is written, The people ſafe down to eat and drink, and roſe up to play. Neither let us commit fornication, as ſome of them committed, and fell in one day three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand. Neither let us tempt Chriſt as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of Serpents. Neither murmur ye, as ſome of them alſo murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were deſtroyed of the Deſtroyer. Now all theſe things happened unto them for exſamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mark, theſe things are our examples. Are

they examples to us, and not warnings too? Are they warnings to us, and muſt we not by them learn to fear and beware? Let him that thinks he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall. My ſoul ſtandeth in a ſure place, my mountain is ſo ſtrong, that I ſhall never be moved. I am ſafe enough, I am in Chriſt, and ſhall not come into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But whatever thou thinkeſt, as ſure as thou thinkeſt thou ſtandeſt, take heed; take heed leſt thou fall: That is, not onely into the ſame ſins, but into the ſame condemnation; that's the ſence of the place. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Becauſe of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief they were broken off, thou ſtandeſt by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No need of fear? No need of threatnings? What may we burn half our Bibles? Can we ſpare ſo great a part of what is written? Have we out-grown the uſe of judgments, aſſoon as ever we are partakers of mercy? Have we out-grown the uſe of the Scourge, aſſoon as ever we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Chriſts School? Do we finde all too little, Mercies, Threatnings, Judgments, to keep our hearts in order? And yet is it more then needs? There are two Parties in us; we are fleſh as well as ſpirit, and muſt not the fleſh be fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Will Love prevail with Luſt? This Slave ſure, this ſon of the Bond-woman muſt be kept in awe. Hath God no wanton children? No rebellious children?

Tear his Bowels, becauſe they are ſo tender to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee? Be froward, ſtubborn, wanton, and idle, becauſe thou haſt found him ſo indulgent?</p>
               <p>Chriſtians conſider, whether ſuch wickedneſs hath not ſometimes been found in ſome of our hearts. But take heed, you will finde, though he be a tender, yet he will not be a fond Father; where he loves, he will be feared. Some as bold and as confident as you, have felt to their coſt, what 'tis to abuſe patience and kindneſs; his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes in their hearts, his Terrors in their ſouls, hath made them to know, that <hi>the God of love is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47970:116"/>
a terrible God.</hi> And look to it, if thou yet wilt adventure, wilt be a wanton ſtill, froward, or idle, or heedleſs ſtill, he will either laſh thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to better manners, or caſt thee out as no childe of his, but a Baſtard, and Rebel. If thou wilt not take warning by others, take heed leſt he make thee a warning to them which ſhall come after.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians know, that though God be tender of his Saints, yet he is jealous for his Name; he tenders them as the Apple of his Eye, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the leaſt title of his Honour. As God will have us love our Neighbour, ſo he will love his childe; but <hi>as himſelf:</hi> Firſt himſelf, and then his childe. He will not bate an <hi>Iota</hi> of his glory, to ſave a world. As little offences <hi>done to</hi> his little ones, ſo little ſins <hi>allowed by them,</hi> are as <hi>Mill ſtones about the neck.</hi> If they allow it in themſelves, yet Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and fall to nothing, ere he allow it in them. God will not, and therefore his children dare not indulge themſelves in little ſins. They therefore fear, becauſe he whom they ſerve is a jealous God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Their own ingenuity.</hi> This fear is from Love and good Nature, and is moſt properly the fear of children.

Children fear, becauſe they love; Slaves fear, although they hate: Children fear to be <hi>unworthy,</hi> Slaves onely to be <hi>unhappy</hi> and miſerable.

We fear evill and not good. The meaning is, they ſhall fear to wrong or abuſe goodneſs: They ſhall fear to wrong the Lord, becauſe he is good. [in the latter dayes] Theſe latter dayes that this Promiſe refers to, ſhall be dayes of more grace; wherein there ſhall be, not onely a more <hi>clear revelation</hi> of the goodneſs of God; they ſhall <hi>know</hi> the Lord and his goodneſs: But a more <hi>plentifull communication,</hi> and diffuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the goodneſs of God; they ſhall <hi>love</hi> the Lord and his goodneſs: They ſhall ſee themſelves both more <hi>obliged</hi> by goodneſs, and ſhall feel themſelves more <hi>ſeaſoned</hi> with goodneſs. By grace they ſhall be better natured. Religion doth not make <hi>moroſe,</hi> but more <hi>generous,</hi> free, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous. There's nothing more abhorrent to an ingenuous ſpirit, then to be baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.

Indeed were I all thanks, I ſhould ſtill be unthankfull; I ſhould ſtill be behind-hand with the goodneſs of the Lord; my debt is greater then I can pay, yea greater then I can acknowledge; but ſhall I return evil for his good?

When the word is let come in with Authority, ſuffered to rule in the ſoul, when the heart gives up it ſelf unto it, then it is accepted; there's its hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The reſolution of the heart for the work of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 110.106. <hi>I have ſworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</hi> I have vowed, and I will perform. I have covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and I am determined to keep thy ſtatutes. <hi>The word which thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not do,</hi> that's the rebellious; <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord ſhall ſpeak, we will do,</hi> that's the obedient heart.</p>
               <p>Where the heart is thus reſolved to obey, this is that obedience, which ſhall be accepted unto ſalvation. Where this reſolution is, as there is opportunity there will be practice; and where
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47970:118"/>
there's not opportunity, in Gods account, this is it. This is Praying, this is Hearing, this is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and feeding, and cloathing, and viſiting; this is walking circumſpectly, working righteouſneſs, ſhewing mercy, exerciſing Faith, and Patience, and Repentance; this is our keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and walking in his Statutes; an heart to obey, is our obeying; an heart to do, is our doing; an heart to ſuffer in Gods account, is our ſuffering for his Name.</p>
               <p>But here it muſt be carefully noted, that though ſincere reſolution for Obedience, be Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, yet every reſolution, is not <hi>that</hi> reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Reſolution for Obedience is then ſincere, where
<list>
                     <item>1. It flowes from an inward and rooted incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</item>
                     <item>2. It's bottomed on a firm belief of Scripture Revelation.</item>
                     <item>3. It's built on the higheſt and weightieſt Reaſons.</item>
                     <item>4. It's the reſult of the moſt mature and deep deliberation.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A ſincere reſolution flowes from an inward rooted inclination,</hi> Pſal. 119.112. <hi>I have inclined mine heart to perform thy ſtatutes.</hi> Our new pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is from our new nature: It is not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſome ſudden fright, or ſence of danger; or meerly by a preſent force of Argument: but by a Divine power, working the heart to a ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the will and waies of God, and an habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all propenſion and inclination thereto. Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for holineſs, without an holy inclination, is a Blade without a Root; as freſh and as green
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47970:119"/>
as it looks, 't will wither and come to nothing; no Ropt, no Fruit, nor laſting. The heart is the root of action, and grace is the life of the root: When our Reſolutions are the Blade, ſprouting forth of this living Root, then they will abide, and bring forth the Ear, and an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A ſincere reſolution is bottomed on a firm Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to the truth of Scripture Revelation.</hi> A Chriſtian reſolves for godlineſs, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves God, that he is as he hath ſaid, <hi>the Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> He is built on the Scriptures; as his hopes, ſo his purpoſes have the foundation of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, on which they ſtand. Whatever Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath not this Foundation, is but as an houſe upon the Sands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A ſincere Reſolution is founded on the higheſt Reaſon.</hi> Where we reſolve without Reaſon, we will quickly find a Reaſon to change. Where we reſolve we know not why, we ſhall change we know not how ſoon. To reſolve we know not why, and to reſolve on we know not what, will be alike unſtable. Though there be Reaſon for Religion, yet Religion may be taken up without Reaſon. Whatever Reaſon there be for it, yet if it be not underſtood, or conſidered, 'tis all one as if there were no Reaſon at all. And if there ſeem ſome Reaſon for it, yet if it be not the higheſt Reaſon, when a ſtronger then it comes, we quickly change our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons we have for our ſerving and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing God, are the higheſt of all Reaſons; and that whether we reſpect it as our duty, or our happineſs. For,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:47970:119"/>
1. <hi>There's none can lay ſuch claim to us as God.</hi> Whoſe am I? Who hath made me? Who hath bought me? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Glorifie God in your bodies and in your ſpirits, which are his.</hi> Pſal. 100.2,3. <hi>Serve the Lord with gladneſs. For the Lord he is God, it is he that hath made us, not we our ſelves, we are his people, and the ſheep of his Paſture.</hi> What reaſon have you to ſerve men, or to ſerve ſin or the world? Men think they have reaſon for it, but what reaſon? Are any of theſe Gods? Are men your Gods? Is ſin or the world God? Do you owe your ſelves to them? <hi>It is he that hath made us, and his we are:</hi> As the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning obedience to Parents, much more may it be ſaid here; Children obey your God, for this is right. This is his due, and your duty; if any one can lay as good a claim to you, let him carry you away for ſervants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There's none can be better to us then God.</hi> None can require, and none can reward our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as he. Where can you be better then with God? Heel require no more, then that you ſerve him till you can find a better Maſter. He that ſaith 'tis beſt to ſerve ſin, and the world, is a fool, and hath <hi>ſaid in his heart, there is no God.</hi> If God be God, he is the chief, yea the onely good. If any thing in the world, upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſoever, be thought better then the Lord, that's ſet up for a God in his room.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whomſoever we ſerve, 'tis God muſt pay us our Wages at laſt.</hi> God is Judge, he is the Rewarder both of the evill and the good, both of thoſe that ſerve him, and thoſe that ſerve him not. If you receive the Lord, he will be your reward; if you
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47970:120"/>
ſerve him not, he will reward you; but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward have you? <hi>Thoſe mine Enemies which will not have me to reign over them, bring them and ſlay them before me;</hi> There's their reward. Sin hath its rewards, but what are they but vanity and vexation? Or if they were better, how long will they laſt? But when ſin hath paid the moſt it can, Oh what a reward is there behinde that God hath to pay you! <hi>This ſhall ye have of mine hand, ye ſhall lye down in ſorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Wages which God will give, ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be bleſſed or dreadfull, according to our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Diſobedience.</hi> The reward that God hath to give, is an eternal reward: Eternal ſalvation to them that obey him, everlaſting deſtruction to him that ſerveth him not.</p>
               <p>I have a ſoul, this carkaſs is the leaſt part of me; there's another world, a world to come; a few years is the moſt I have to ſpend in this; I muſt abide eternally, eternally in the other world.</p>
               <p>How inconſiderable is it what I have here, whether little or more, better or worſe; in a ſhort time that will come all to one. But oh my eternity what's that like to be? Why tis God that muſt determine it, and he will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every man according to his works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6,7,8,9,10. <hi>Who will render to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deeds. To them which by patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, honour, and immortality, eternal life. But to them that are contentious and obey not the truth, tribulation and anguiſh, &amp;c.</hi> There's glory and ſhame, mercy and wrath, life and death ſet before me; there's
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47970:120"/>
no third ſtate, one of the two muſt be my lot, and this is it that doth determine which; <hi>If I obey I live, if I diſobey I die for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when my reſolution is founded on ſuch Reaſons as theſe, then which none can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined higher and more weighty; (till eternity become of leſs regard then time, and an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſoul be ſet below a periſhing body) and when the queſtion being put, Shall I follow God or not? God or the world? God or my luſt? Speak ſoul, give in thy Anſwer; when this is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it gives, Why there's none can lay ſuch claim to me as God; there's none can be as good to me as God; whomſoever I ſerve, its God muſt be my Rewarder; my everlaſting bleſſedneſs, or eternal ruine depends on him, and muſt be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly determined, according to my obedience or diſobedience: This is the plain caſe, Obey, and Live: Obey, or die for ever. And therefore what can I ſay leſs or more, but that I am the Lords, and will be his Servant. Let others chuſe whom they will ſerve, as for me, O my ſoul, ſerve thou the Lord. This reſolution thus founded, is like to ſtand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A ſincere Reſolution, is the fruit of mature deliberation.</hi> Deliberation gives Reaſon its full weight; makes the ſtrength of it appear; it layes all things in the Ballance; its the comparing of Reaſons for, and againſt; the weighing of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Objections; encouragements, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements; caſting the coſt, as well as the gain: particularly, In this deliberation there muſt be a conſidering,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What there is in this Obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:47970:121"/>
2. What it is attended with that may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There muſt be a conſidering, What there is in this Obedience:</hi> Or otherwiſe we reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we know not what. Now there are five things in this Obedience:
<list>
                     <item>Subjection.</item>
                     <item>Activity and Induſtry.</item>
                     <item>Integrity.</item>
                     <item>Circumſpection.</item>
                     <item>Spirituality.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Subjection.</hi> Servants muſt be ſubject, muſt not be at their own wills, but at the will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The heart of man naturally affects Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; that's the great controverſie of ſinners with God, <hi>Who ſhall be Lord? We are Lords,</hi> (we would be at leaſt) <hi>we will come no more unto thee, Jer.</hi> 2.31. Obedience yields that God ſhould be Lord; yea and all others alſo, whom he hath made Lords over us. The ſervants of Chriſt muſt not be, and yet muſt be the ſervants of men; they muſt not ſerve the luſts, but muſt be ſubject to their righteous Lawes and Commands. God muſt be obeyed; and Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Parents muſt be obeyed in the Lord, and for the Lord; yea and they muſt be, when God will have it ſo the Servants of ſervants.</p>
               <p>While they muſt not ſerve the humours of the greateſt, they muſt ſerve the neceſſities of the meaneſt; muſt ſtoop to the loweſt of Offices, even to the waſhing of the feet of the leaſt Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: All this the Lord expects of them, and they muſt be ſubject. They muſt not diſpute, but do his will; onely it muſt be conſidered, that there
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47970:121"/>
is a double diſputing the will of God: There is a diſputing whether that which is pretended to be the wil of God, be ſo or no; this ought to be done. And there is a diſputing or queſtioning that, which is granted to be the will of God, whether it be fit to be done or ſafe to be done: Is it not better to let it alone? What advantage is there in it? What reaſon is there for it? No, they muſt not thus diſpute; this is Reaſon enough, God will have it ſo. Gods will is ever Reaſon, and it muſt be our Reaſon. It's enough for thee to ſay, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath commanded,</hi> and I muſt be ſubject. This is one thing that muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I will Obey, but can I be Subject?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Activity and Induſtry.</hi> The ſervant of the Lord muſt be Active, and Induſtrious. Whom he ſends into the Vineyard, he ſends to work, and not to ſleep. The life of a Chriſtian is labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; whileſt others are in their beds, he muſt be on his knees: whileſt others take their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he muſt take Pains: whileſt others take their times, now a little, and then a little, he muſt ſit at it, be ever about his Maſters buſineſs. An active ſpirit, is an <hi>excellent</hi> ſpirit and tis <hi>neceſſary</hi> in a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Active ſpirit, is an Excellent ſpirit; Sluggards are the refuſe of the Earth.</p>
               <p>But here it muſt be conſidered, that there is a double Activity, Naturall, and Gracious.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Natural,</hi> which ariſes from an innate vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and vivacity of ſome mens ſpirits: There needs not induſtry in ſuch, to bring forth action, 'tis but leaving nature to its courſe, and that will fly high enough of it ſelf. It requires more Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47970:122"/>
to regulate and ſometimes to reſtrain, then to put forth into Action. Its more labour for them to reſt, then to be doing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Gracious:</hi> Which is either Natural Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, managed and improved for God, turn'd into a right courſe, running in a right Channel; or a Naturally Unactive ſpirit, raiſed and quickened by grace, and Religious Induſtry. This gracious, this holy Activity, this is the Excellency; it is the extract of the ſpirits and life of all our Parts and graces; and will go further, and do more high Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and more abundant ſervice to God and his Goſpel then is done by a thouſand others.</p>
               <p>An Active Sinner, is by accident the worſt of men: How much ſervice for the Devil will he diſpatch in a little time?</p>
               <p>An Active ſinner is <hi>life and death met together.</hi> He is all life, and yet dead, and the more he hath of death, becauſe ſo much of life; like poyſon in Wine, he deſtroyes the more effectually: Yet the evill is not in his Activity, but in the matters wherein he is imployed; the good mettal, or keenes of a Weapon, is its Excellency; but in a mad mans hand better a wooden then an iron ſword. An Active Spirit is ſo Excellent, that its pity that ever ſin ſhould have the uſing of it; 't were well for Religion, if the Devil were a Drone, and had no other ſervants but the Sluggards of the Earth. But Activity when ſet right is of great price in the ſight of God: It is of great price in the ſight of God, becauſe it ſets a great price upon God. Slothfulneſs puts a ſlight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God; when the Scriptures have ſet forth the <hi>Magnalia Dei,</hi> the great things, and the deep
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47970:122"/>
things of God, when the Lord Jeſus is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth as crucified before our eyes, as the Propitiation for ſin; when the preciouſneſs of his blood, the tenderneſs of his bowels, the riches of his grace, the ſufficiency of his righteouſneſs, his ſatisfaction and pardons, are all held forth in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſight; when the beauties of holineſs, the joyes of the ſpirit, that peace which paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, are laid forth to view; when the moſt glorious things are ſpoken of the City of God, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above; when God in his word calls to us, Awake ſleepers, ariſe ſluggards, ſee whats before you; all this may be yours, if you will; Sloathfulneſs puts this ſlight upon all, Tuſh, all this is not worth the breaking my ſleep for; 'tis not all worth my labour to ſeek after; my eaſe and my quiet is better to me, then God and all his glory.</p>
               <p>We may beſt underſtand the value we put on things, by the pains and the coſt we are content to be at to purchaſe them. When ſinners beſtow themſelves ſo upon the world, will bear ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and travell, are ſo conſtantly ſo, indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly induſtrious in the purſuance of it; and withall, run ſuch hazards and dangers for it, they make it evident enough what rate they put upon it; he whoſe time, and his ſtrength, whoſe days and his nights, yea whoſe ſoul, and his hopes, muſt all be laid out in a purchaſe, muſt all go for a piece of Land, or a little money, or pleaſure; we need no other proof, what a bargain he thinks this world to be. <hi>I care not much for this world, 'tis a vanity, a ſhadow, the faſhion of it paſſeth away; I hope tis far enough off my heart, how ever I am char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47970:123"/>
with greedineſs after it:</hi> But what then mean all the expences of thy time, of thy ſtrength, of thy ſpirits, that thou daily layeſt out upon it? What means ſo much hunting after, and heaping it up for thy ſelf? What, haſt thou been hunting all this while after ſhadowes? Heaping up vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? No, no, thou miſtakeſt thy ſelf, theſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes are thy ſubſtance; theſe vanities are the God whom thou adoreſt: If thou didſt not prize, thou wouldſt not venture ſo deeply for them.</p>
               <p>And ſo on the other ſide, when ſo little is done for God: When any thing muſt ſuffice to be ſpent on ſouls, or eternity; what cheap things do we count them! I love God above all; with all my heart, with all my ſoul; he is all my hope, and all my deſire; what a miſerable creature were I, if it were not for my hope in God? What would all the world be to me, ſhould I loſe my ſoul? But doſt thou ſpeak in earneſt? Doſt thou think what thou ſpeakeſt? What, and ſo very a Drone in ſeeking of God? What, and ſo indifferent, ſo cold, and ſo ſpiritleſs in thy enquiries after him, in thy motions towards him? So ſparing of thy labour, ſo negligent of duty, ſo ſeldom at it, ſo ſoon weary, ſo many delayes, ſo many excuſes? How many times hath God called thee after him, and all thine anſwer hath been an excuſe? An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe inſtead of an Ordinance, an excuſe inſtead of a Prayer, an excuſe inſtead of Action, an excuſe inſtead of an Alms, an excuſe inſtead of an Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, or a Reproof; if he will be ſerved with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, he ſhall have ſervice enough, but little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. I am weary, or tis too late, or tis cold, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47970:123"/>
and ſo a ſhort, and haſty Prayer muſt ſerve, or none at all. I have much buſineſs upon me, a Family, a Farm, and the cares and trouble of it, that I cannot have ſo much time nor freedom to attend upon God as others have; and ſo a Sermon loſt, a Sacrament loſt. I live amongſt ill neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, if I ſhould be ſo forward, and ſo active for God, ſo zealous, and ſo ſpiritual in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in my way, I ſhould be but a ſcoff and a reproach, and it may be a prey to evill men. I want ability to ſpeak to the edification of others, I have not the boldneſs as others have, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or admoniſh; I pray thee have me excuſed. Wiſe men indeed, an Excuſe inſtead of a Duty! 'Tis all one, as if when the Lord calls to thee, <hi>Come to me and be ſaved,</hi> thy Anſwer ſhould be, I pray thee excuſe me, I muſt to the Devil and be damned.</p>
               <p>But is this thy love? Is this thy zeal? Is this thy valuing of God above all?</p>
               <p>Tremble Sluggard, whatever excuſes thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt out, ro ſubſtitute in the room of duty, this is that thou canſt never excuſe, nor acquit thy ſelf of <hi>a ſlighting of God.</hi> Thy very excuſes will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thee for a ſloathful ſervant, and this for a ſlighter of God: Whileſt the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon that the ſufferings of this life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed:</hi> But I reckon ſaiſt thou, that all that glory to come, is not worthy to be compared with the preſent labour.</p>
               <p>But now Activity and Induſtry puts a great price upon God, this is written upon all our labours, <hi>He is worthy for whom I do all this.</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:47970:124"/>
ſome of the moſt humble watchful laborious Chriſtians, do ſometimes complain, Oh I fear, I love not God; his Favour, his Honour is little ſet by me; but whence then is thy care to pleaſe God? Whence are all thy labours of love? Do'ſt watch, and pray, and work, and run? Can'ſt ſpend and be ſpent for God, and yet not love him? Do'ſt live to God, can'ſt dye for God, and yet not prize him? What greater proof can'ſt give of love, then ſuch labour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Activity is <hi>neceſſary.</hi> It is a vain thing to think of making any thing of Religion without it; the work of it is too great, to be done by lying ſtill; the comforts of it lye too deep, to be gotten out by a wiſh. There's many a poor man in this world, that would be the richeſt man in the Countrey, if riches may be gotten by a wiſh; he may aſſoon with himſelf into wealth, as thou into grace and comfort. This one thing, mens not being able to bear the labour of Religion, is a Rock, at which many a ſoul hath ſplit, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered an eternal wrack.</p>
               <p>He that hath ſome love to holineſs, and yet not ſo much as to carry him through the work of holineſs, is ſhort of ſincerity; and ſhort of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, ſhort of ſalvation. He that ſticks not at labour, will not ſtick at ſuffering: He that ſluggs at doing, will ſhrink back from ſuffering. Say not, There's a Lion in the ſtreets; overcome the Lion, and you will not fear the Bear: Get over (Difficulties) and there's but one ſtill more. (Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs) betwixt thee and glory. Paſs the firſt, and thou wilt be the more bold to venture the latter. Holy Activity will be a witneſs of thy ſincerity;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47970:124"/>
carry this witneſs in thine heart, and then, which way ever the world does go, and what ſtorms ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may fall, thou wilt have this to uphold thee, <hi>Integrity and uprightneſs ſhall preſerve me, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity reward me.</hi> Where Sincerity is the root, and holy Activity the bloſſom, an eternal weight of glory ſhall be the fruit. Lye idle, and all will be loſt. Take heed of <hi>(Soul take thine eaſie,)</hi> leſt the next word thou hear be <hi>[This night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee.]</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Of one comprehenſive duty, wherein all the reſt are included, and on which they depend; and that is, <hi>The holding up, and maintaining Gods Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the ſoul.</hi> As God hath ſet up his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>over</hi> the ſoul; his word which is to have the government of it, ſo hath he ſet up an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>in</hi> the ſoul; the Underſtanding and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Theſe Powers, as they are <hi>under Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> under the Authority of the word; ſo they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47970:125"/>
are ſet in <hi>Authority,</hi> over the ſubordinate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour faculties, the Will, and the Paſſions, or Affections. But ſin now hath made a mutiny, and Inſurrection; the Will riſes againſt Reaſon, and will not be guided; the Paſſions rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conſcience, and will not be governed; nay they do not onely reſiſt, but take upon them to command, and impoſe upon Conſcience: What the Will would have, Conſcience muſt ſay tis Reaſon it ſhould have; muſt be put upon it, to finde out Arguments, to prove Will to be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and to determine, that what the Will would have done, ought to be done, <hi>facile credimus quod nimis volumus:</hi> We eaſily bring our Opinion to our Affection; bring our ſelves to believe that to be right, which we are unreaſonably willing to have to be tight: But if it cannot prevail thus far, to gain Conſcience to ſay that's right, which it would have to be right, then it will put hard for it, to carry it whether it be right or wrong. And this rebellion of the Will, and ſo of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions againſt the Reaſon, is the great reaſon of the ſouls rebellion againſt God.</p>
               <p>When Conſcience hath loſt its Authority, Gods Authority is gone. Whileſt the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the Conſcience are maintained in their due Authority, where the Will and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are held in their due ſubjection, there the Lord reigneth. While Conſcience rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd hath its due, God ſhall have his due: Where the Will and the Paſſions have no more then their due, he ſhall have his own. God ſhall be will'd the more, where nothing elſe is will'd too much. God ſhall be loved the more,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47970:125"/>
and feared the more, where nothing elſe is lov'd and fear'd too much. The more Anger, the more Hatred, the more Grief will be ſpent upon ſin, if it be not inordinately ſpent elſewhere. Oh how much ſervice might be done, and how much quiet would be enjoyed in the heart, were this Authority and Subjection maintained and held up.</p>
               <p>We may ſay of our Affections, as men ſay of Fire and Water, <hi>They are the worſt Maſters, but the beſt Servants.</hi> How much ſhould the Lord have of us, were theſe onely the Executioners of his will. If Conſcience be commanded by the word, and the Will and Affections would be commanded by Conſcience, what would there then be wanting? We ſhould then not onely be abundantly ſerviceable, but all would be ſerene, and ſweet, and comfortable within us. If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were will'd, but what ſhould be will'd, we ſhould ever have our will. If nothing were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, but what ſhould be deſired, and no more then it ſhould be lov'd or deſired, we ſhould ever have what we love. If we were not angry, or grieved, or afraid, but where we ought, and no more then we ought; what a calm would there be upon our ſpirits, even in ſuch caſes, wherein the ſpirits of others are like a troubled Sea, that cannot be at reſt, whoſe waters caſt forth mire and dirt: But where there is ſuch diſorder, ſuch rebellion of the Inferiour againſt the Superiour Faculties, there we are at a perpetual loſs, both in point of duty and comfort. This therefore is neceſſary, if we will be obedient: And thoſe that have prov'd what there is in it, do underſtand that this is hard work.</p>

2. I ſhall inſtance in ſome few particular duties that are <hi>harder then others.</hi> He that will be entirely obedient, muſt ſtick at nothing that God will have. There's ſcarce any thing that God requires, but Luſt will be quarrelling at, as too hard; but there are ſome duties harder then others. It ſhall ſuffice onely to name them: <hi>The denyal of our ſelves. The diſobliging our near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends. The loving our Enemies. The diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying all the world, in their unrighteous commands. Obeying God, rather then men; returning good for evill.

               </p>
               <p>Well, this alſo muſt be conſidered ere you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve; you will obey, But are you for any thing, for every thing the Lord requires?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Circumſpection</hi> and care, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly.</hi> A little labour will go far with care, but will be nothing without it. 'Tis not he that is hot, and buſie, and active at all adventures; he that keeps to his Line and his Rule, hee's the obedient Chriſtian. 'Tis not ſo much Action, as regular Action, wherein the life of Chriſtianity lies. He that lives by rule, peace be on him, and mercy. Activity without care, is <hi>Extravagancie:</hi> 'Tis care that keeps within compaſs. He that is all Action, has the more need of caution. A Chriſtian muſt have his eyes in his head, as well as a ſoul in his body. He that reſolves well in Generals, and comes not off in Particulars, does but build Caſtles in the Air. What we ordinarily are, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47970:126"/>
Particulars, will beſt prove what we are. He that is for any thing but this, any time but now, is for nothing.</p>
               <p>Circumſpection notes two things:
<list>
                     <item>Taking notice.</item>
                     <item>Taking heed.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>He that will be circumſpect, muſt eye and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what's before him; muſt have his eye upon his <hi>End,</hi> his <hi>Rule,</hi> and his <hi>Goings;</hi> muſt eye duty and ſin, opportunities and temptations, his times and ſeaſons; he muſt <hi>take heed,</hi> as well as take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; muſt keep a ſtrict eye on himſelf, and hold a ſtrict hand on himſelfe, that he leap not over a duty, nor turn aſide to iniquity; muſt ſet a guard upon himſelf, upon his tongue, upon his eyes, upon his appetite, upon his company, upon his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, upon his thoughts, upon his paſſions, upon all the motions of his ſoul, and the actions of his body.</p>
               <p>This will require ſomething. What not a word but muſt be weighed? Not a look but muſt be look'd to? Not a thought but muſt be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined? Not a ſin to be allowed? Not a duty to be abated? Not a circumſtance to be neglected? Muſt all be in Weight and in Meaſure, by Line, and by Rule, and this alwais too? If <hi>ſomething</hi> might ſerve, if <hi>ſometimes</hi> might ſuffice, it might be borne; but to keep touch in every point, and that every day, this is an hard ſaying indeed. But thus it muſt be, to live as a Chriſtian, and to walk exactly, accurately, preciſely, is the ſame thing. Duty and ſin, though they be as far diſtant as Heaven and Hell, yet there is but an hair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. The leaſt latitude is a tranſgreſſion,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:47970:127"/>
either all this, (that is as to the purpoſe of the heart;) either all this, or nothing.</p>
               <p>Well, all this muſt be conſidered; You will be Obedient, but will you be circumſpect?</p>

Chriſtians Obedience, is their walking in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians Obedience is their <hi>walking in the Spirit.</hi> They have received the Spirit, and they walk in the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit of this world, (their ſpirit is not fleſh) but the Spirit which is of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. They are dead to things carnal, the ſpirit of the world is departed, they have given up this ghoſt: 'Tis the Spirit of the living God that lives in them, and in this they live and walk. They walk in the <hi>Light</hi> of the Spirit, in the <hi>Power</hi> of the Spirit; the Spirit of the Lord ſteets their Courſe, and fills their Sails; is their Pilot, and their Star, and their Wind that carries them on. When they pray, they pray in the Spirit; when they hear, they hear in the Spirit; through the Spirit, they mortifie the fleſh, are crucified to the world; they obey, they ſuffer, they fight, they overcome, through the Spirit of the living God
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47970:128"/>
that is in them: They live in <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with the Spirit, and by him with the Father and the Son. They dwell in the inviſible world, their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and converſe is in Heaven, thither they have acceſs, and there they have acceptance; thither they have their recourſe, and thence they have their returns. Duties and comforts, are the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens that are paſſing betwixt Heaven and Earth. Their life is Love, and Joy, and Praiſe; theſe are the moſt noble acts of their Obedience, and theſe give Wings to their hearts, carry them on more ſwiftly, and more ſweetly through all their courſe.</p>
               <p>Oh how heavily do we drive on, how ſlowly do our Wheels move, when the Spirit of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God is not in the Wheels. Oh how dead are our Duties, how lame are our walkings, what low and poor ſpirited creatures are we: How weak are our hearts, how unripe our fruits; we do but half do what we do, there is no heart in our life, we are as bodies without ſouls, whileſt our ſoul is without a Spirit. Oh how ſad is it with many of us, upon this account! By our eſtrangement from God, we have even loſt our ſelves; we are not what we are, becauſe we are no more where he is. By our diſtances from Heaven, we are even choaked with the damps of the Earth. We are fit for little, we proſper in nothing, God takes no pleaſure, and we take no comfort in any thing we do, our ſpirits are ſo chil'd and benummed within, as that we neither make ſign in our work, not ridance of our way And what are we in our Societies? To how little profit do we meet? How little heat do we get
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47970:128"/>
yea how much do we loſe at our brethrens fires? We ſerve often, but to damp and cool each others ſpirits; as if it might be no longer ſaid, <hi>Wo to him that is alone,</hi> but wo be to him that is in company; alone hee's more warm.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, I ſolemnly profeſs, I am aſhamed of my ſelf, and my heart is pained within me, to obſerve how inſipid, how ſpiritleſs, how carnal our converſes are; how often may we meet? How long may we ſit, Chriſtian with Chriſtian, ere any thing that ſavours of the ſpirit of a Chriſtian comes from us? Oh how hard muſt we ſtrain for a few gracious words! How little does come? How heartleſs when it comes? How very few of us are there, whoſe ordinary converſe ſpeaks us to be men of another world, whoſe buſineſs, and whoſe delight lyes above, and are in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt preſſing on towards Heaven? How ſeldom, and how ſhort-breath'd are our ſpiritual diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? How little muſt ſuffice? How quickly are we diverted to things carnal and ſenſual? Sure 'tis our little communion with God, that hath thus incarnated and communion of Saints.</p>
               <p>Oh let us live more in the fellowſhip of the Spirit, and we ſhall have fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to better purpoſe. Lets warm our ſelves at the Sun, lets dwell more in his Beams, and we ſhall get and give more Light and Heat. Thus muſt it be conſidered ere we reſolve, what there is in this Obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be conſidered, <hi>What it is like to be attended withall from without.</hi> What ſuffering it may coſt us, what ſcorn, and contempt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and perſecutions of all ſorts; it's like to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47970:129"/>
ſet Earth and Hell upon our backs; if carnal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and fleſhly policies, if all the powers of darkneſs, if might and malice can do it, this way will be made too hot, and too hard for thee: Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, great tribulation thou muſt expect, and canſt not eſcape; and the more ſtrict and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the hotter muſt thou look thine Aſſaults will be.</p>
               <p>Profeſſors of Religion that are of the largeſt ſize, that are not ſo ſtrict to their Rule, but they can diſpence with Duty: nor ſo forward in point of Zeal and Activity, but they can remit and abate as occaſion ſerves, may eſcape this perſecuting world the better; but he that will be faithful, who ever eſcape, is ſure to be made a Prey. This alſo muſt be well conſidered, I will follow Chriſt, but can I drink of the Cup that he drank of? Can I be baptized with the Baptiſme, the Baptiſme of Blood that he was baptized with?</p>
               <p>There are perſons, who ſometimes take up the profeſſion of Religion, and reſolve all on a ſudden they will follow Chriſt; not underſtanding what there is in it, or what Chriſtianity may ſtand them in; who by that they have look'd a little farther, and finde it another manner of difficulty, then at firſt they imagined; and withall finde the Armies of the Aliens to fall on, the Doggs to tear, the Wolves to worry, the Eagles, and the Vultures, and all the Birds of Prey, to pitch upon them; and begin in earneſt to feel the ſmart of Religion, in thoſe perſecutions that are raiſ'd upon them for it, preſently make their retreat, and go back. <hi>Where am I? What have I choſen? Is this to be a Chriſtian? Doth Chriſt look for all this from his
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47970:129"/>
followers, and will he leave them to ſuch violence and rapine, as the reward of their faithfulneſs to his name? I never thought it had been ſuch hot ſervice, and if I cannot be a Saint at a cheaper rate then this, follow Chriſt who will for me; let thoſe that have nothing to loſe, or can bear ſo much labour, and pains, and violence, take it up if they pleaſe; for my part, I muſt look to my ſelf,</hi> I <hi>muſt not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Maſter I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goeſt, ſaid that Scribe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.7. Man thou underſtandeſt not what thou ſayeſt. Doeſt know whither I am going, where my dwelling, what my lodging is? <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the ayre have neſts, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head:</hi> And behold there's an end of the Scribes Chriſtianity, we hear not one word more of it.</p>
               <p>But now, he that both knows what 'tis to be a Diſciple, that hath look'd through Religion, through the length and breadth of it; hath duly weighed all that can be ſaid for, or againſt his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it up; hath <hi>examined the grounds</hi> and reaſons he hath for it, what weight there is in them; hath <hi>conſidered the Objections,</hi> hath caſt up the coſt and charges of it, and as the iſſue and reſult of the moſt ſerious debate, ſtands <hi>ſettled in his judgment,</hi> that all things conſidered, it is indiſputably the beſt, and wiſeſt, and ſafeſt courſe he can take; <hi>its beyond all controverſie, without all</hi> diſpute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably better for me, to hearken to the Lord in all that he ſhall require, and to run all hazards with him and that preſently, from this day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to the end of my life: He that ſtands thus
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47970:130"/>
ſettled in his judgment and thereupon feels his ſoul fixing it ſelf in this <hi>peremtory reſolution;</hi> well, through the grace of God, I will be his ſervant; I give up my ſelf to the government of his will; to follow him in righteouſnes and holineſs all my daies. I am ſenſible its no light thing to be a Chriſtian, I ſee I muſt be ſubject, I ſee I muſt be circumſpect I ſee I muſt be active, I muſt ſtick at nothing that God will have; I ſee this fleſh wil be pained and put hard to it wil fling &amp; groan under ſo ſevere a yoke: I ſee the Devil and this evil world will be upon me, laying on more lord, to make my bargain as dear as they can: But be there in it what there will, let it coſt me never ſo dear, I am at a point; I will venture all upon it, the Lord is my God, and him will I follow in all things that he ſhall ſpeak; I put my ſelf into the everlaſting Arms; I truſt upon everlaſting ſtrength; I will go forth in the Name of the Lord, and now ſpeak Lord, for I will hear.</p>
               <p>This ſincere reſolution, this will hold out; when our holy inclinations are ſo rooted and ſtrong, that they hear down all fleſhly inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; when our aſſent to Scripture is ſo firm, that it over balances all Objections againſt it; when our Reaſons for Religion are ſo high and weighty, that they weigh down the higheſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences againſt it; when we have throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what there is in it, and compar'd all that can be ſaid, for or againſt our following the Lord, and upon the whole matter we judge it our beſt courſe, and accordingly reſolve for it, this is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere reſolution, this is the Obedience of the heart.</p>

2. <hi>Obedience of the Life,</hi> This is the <hi>Decree bringing forth,</hi> or holy inclination and reſolution ſpringing up into action, and is a neceſſary proof of the ſoundneſs of the reſolution.</p>
               <p>Though ſincere reſolution be Obedience in Gods account, yet that reſolution which (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing there be time and opportunity) does not break forth into act, is undoubtedly unſound and deceitful. There are two things infallibly included in Spiritual life; <hi>a Will, and a Power.</hi> Grace is <hi>the diſpoſing, and the enabling</hi> the heart for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and where there is both a Will, and a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, performance will certainly follow. This ſincerity of actual Obedience, is that which the Prayer of the Pſalmiſt looks to, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.80. <hi>Let my heart be ſound [in thy ſtatutes] that I be not aſhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a <hi>ſoundneſs in the Faith, and a ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Statutes</hi> of the Lord. Faith notes in Scripture, either <hi>the Doctrine</hi> of faith, or the Grace of faith. And accordingly, ſoundneſs in the faith, ſignifies both the receiving and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſound Doctrine, and the ſound or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere imbracing that Doctrine. Soundneſs in the Statutes of the Lord, notes eſpecially <hi>the Practice,</hi> the living or walking uprightly, under the Power of that Doctrine, under the Government and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Statutes of the Lord. What this Obedience of life is, its eaſie to gather out of what hath been ſpoken touching the Obedience of the heart; I ſhall onely adde, that this Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is then ſound and ſincere, when</p>
               <p n="1">1. In General, the whole courſe of life is the iſſue of the mentioned ſincere reſolution; when

the life is the birth of the purpoſe, the fruit grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up out of the holy Root. There may be actions Materially good and holy, that yet are not gracious actions; becauſe they ariſe not from a right ſpring. When the ſoul hath devoted it ſelf to God in Chriſt, and <hi>believingly, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,</hi> and <hi>deliberately</hi> decreed and determined in his ſtrength to keep his word; and this decree or determination, goes into the performances of the life, and is the root and ſoul of that holy courſe we walk in, there's ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some perſons may be found, who have taken up the Profeſſion, and go farr in the practice of godlineſs; abſtaining from groſs ſins, yea and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king attempts upon the mortification of inward Luſts; applying themſelves to the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; Praying, Hearing, Reading, Meditating, Diſcourſing of God, and the things of God; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing themſelves in the works of righteouſneſs and mercy; being Meek, Temperate, Patient; and yet if all this do ariſe onely from the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a good Nature, good Education, good Society and Acquaintance, a powerful Miniſtry, or the workings of natural Conſcience; as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it may, and doth not ſpring forth from ſuch a fixed, well bottomed reſolution, it is ſhort of ſincerity. Whatever the Blades be, they have no Root, and will certainly wither away.</p>

In Particular actions, when they are done in ſimplicity; and ſingleneſs of heart unto the Lord; when whatever ſinful mixtures there may ſometimes be of carnal reſpects, that may have an influence upon the exerting and bringing them forth; yet the great poise that moves the Wheels,

               <p>The Perſeverance of the Saints, is founded on the <hi>Election</hi> of God, and the immutability of his Counſel; <hi>The foundation of the Lord ſtandeth ſure,</hi> Rom. 8.38. <hi>Whom he did Predeſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> This golden Chain will hold, not a link of it ſhall be broken: on whomſoever the firſt link <hi>Election</hi>

               <p>There are two ſorts of Promiſes concerning Perſeverance. There are Promiſes—
<list>
                     <item>To Perſeverance.</item>
                     <item>Of Perſeverance.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Promiſe of eternal life is made <hi>to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</hi> Hold out to the end, and be ſaved. Overcome and reign. <hi>Be faithful to the death, and I will give thee a Crown of life.</hi> Rev. 2,10. <hi>If thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off for ever.</hi> 1 Chron. 28.9. <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Chriſtians, beware of Apoſtacy, beware of Preſumption; <hi>Paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear.</hi> Let it not be ſaid of you, ye (did) run well: He runs well, that gives not off, that ſits not down on this ſide the goal. <hi>So run that ye may obtain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are Promiſes <hi>of Perſeverance.</hi> The Covenant of God, is an everlaſting Covenant. He hath commanded his Covenant for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.5.</p>
               <p>There are two things in the fore-mentioned Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. ſecured to Believers, which ſecure their Perſeverance.
<list>
                     <item>1. God will not depart from them.</item>
                     <item>2. They ſhall not depart from him.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. God will not depart from them. <hi>I will not turn aw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47970:132"/>
to do them good. I will never fail thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſhall not depart from him. 'Tis true, the Lord will be with me, but tis onely while I am with him; if I depart, he wil depart: if I forſake him, he will ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> me off for ever. Here's my great fear, that I ſhall turn away from him; there is in me an evil heart of unbelief, that's ever departing from the living God. Oh this falſe and fickle heart, I dare not truſt it for a day, I dare not undertake for it for an hour; I doubt it will be gone ere I am aware; my corruptions are ſtrong, my temptations are many, every day brings its temptations; and I am in great fear that by one means or other, one day or other, I ſhal fall before them, and depart from the living God! No ſaies God, fear not, thou ſhalt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me. They ſhall be kept by my Almighty Power, through faith unto ſalvation.</hi> My grace ſhall be with them, and my grace ſhall be ſufficient for them; and ſhall preſerve them to my Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And here is the Saints ſecurity: The Lord God will not turn away from them, nor ever ſuffer them to run away from him. If the Promiſe fail, then may their faith alſo fail. Its true, there may be <hi>gradual</hi> declinings, and departures of the Saints from Chriſt for a ſeaſon, but <hi>total or final</hi> there ſhall not be: They ſhall not be <hi>of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the ſaving of the ſoul.</hi> Though they fall, they ſhall riſe again; they may turn, but they ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. As Hypocrites will not ſtay (with) Chriſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47970:133"/>
alwaies, ſo neither will Saints alwais ſtay from him. And there's a like reaſon of both: Sinners ſometimes will ſtep aſide, and ſalute Religion, and take ſome turnes with Chriſt; but after a while, away they muſt again: And there is a double Reaſon of it,
<list>
                     <item>1. There's that within them</item>
                     <item>2. There's one without them</item>
                  </list>
That will fetch them back.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There's that <hi>within them</hi> that will fetch them back. Corrupt nature, the power of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified Luſt, this it that bears the ſway in their hearts; and however for the time, the ſtream may be ſomewhat turn'd out of its courſe, or bayd up; however by the <hi>impetus</hi> of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Motives or Arguments, or the <hi>impulſes</hi> of an awakened Conſcience, or ſome ſudden heat of affection, they are carried on after, and in ſome fair compliance with the Lord Jeſus; yet when the Bay is removed, when the external force is ſpent, Conſcience laid to ſleep, the heat of affection allaid, which is often almoſt as ſoon out as in; thou very natures will reduce, and bring them back to their old courſe. What is it that pulls a Stone, or a lump of Clay down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that is thrown into the Ayr? Why when the <hi>vis impreſſa</hi> by which they were forc'd up, is ſpent, their natures, their innate gravities will bring them down to their place. Sinners need no other weights to pull them down to this Earth, then their earthly hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's <hi>one without them</hi> that will fetch them off. Satan the god of this world, whoſe they are, and whom they ſerve; who though he indulge them ſo much liberty for their Religion,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47970:133"/>
as is conſiſtent with their captive ſtate, and may poſſibly ſecure them the more under his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, (Hypocrites are often the faſter to Satan, for being ſo near to Chriſt) the very Religion they have, is but the Devils ſnare, by which he holds them back from Religion; yet leſt by ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing them too farr, they ſhould be loſt to him at laſt, he that firſt tempted them ſo near to Chriſt, (Hypocrites are often beholding to the Devil for their Religion they have) will quickly tempt them back again.</p>
               <p>And ſo on the other ſide, there are the like Reaſons why Saints cannot alwaies wander, or ſtay ſway from Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There's that <hi>within them,</hi> which will bring them back. <hi>the grace of God</hi> within them, will bring them home. The grace of God, is now their nature. Sinners whileſt walking with Chriſt, and Saints whileſt wandring from Chriſt, are both <hi>under a force;</hi> they are carried againſt the ſtream, when the winds are down that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them on, they will return to their courſe. The grace of God is the <hi>ſeed of God, He that is born of God, ſinneth not;</hi> (that is, not unto death) <hi>the ſeed of God remaineth in him.</hi> Thy ſeed of God is <hi>immortal ſeed;</hi> it may languiſh, and be ready to dye, but it ſhall not dye, it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's <hi>one above them</hi> which will bring them back. Though he ſuffer them for a time, to wander from the way; yet he will not ſuffer them to periſh from the way. <hi>Of thoſe whom thou haſt given me, I have loſt none. He hath</hi> loſt none, and he will loſe none. He ſends <hi>a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47970:134"/>
word of command</hi> after them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Return O lack ſliding children, for I am married to you.</hi> Whither are you running? Whom are you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after? Come back from your Lovers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to your Husband; I am married to you, and we may not part;</p>
               <p>After the word of Command, he ſends <hi>a word of Promiſe,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>I will heal your back-ſlidings.</hi> Return from your back-ſlidings, and I will heal them. I will forgive your back-ſlidings, and I wil cure you of your back ſliding heart. All the Breaches they have made, ſhall be made up; I will paſs by all that you have done, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to you. If you will return, return and I will receive you. And this word of Promiſe, is a <hi>word of Power. I will bring you to Zion: then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will go and return to my firſt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> Hoſ. 2. <hi>Behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God,</hi> Jer. 3.22. He that will not leave his <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, with their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols much leſs will he leave his <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Spirit. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he that hath begun a good work, will perform it until the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A good work may be ſaid to be begun in dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When there is ſome good think a doing:</hi> Or when ſomething is done towards it; when it is <hi>in fieri.</hi> When the Lord hath been ploughing up the fallow ground, making his Batteries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtrong Hold, ſhaking ſecure hearts, breaking falſe hopes, awakening Conſciences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing ſinners, ſpreading ſin, and death, and hell, before them entring upon a Treaty with them,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47970:134"/>
and perſwading them over to Chriſt, to make an eſcape: There may be hopes in this, The pains of Travel gives hopes of a Birth. But this may go back, and after the higheſt hopes, prove an abortion. Sinners, awakened ſinners, beware you make not a ſtand at the Threſhold; beware that your Plough'd ground be not left to lye fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Beware that the Womb prove not the Grave of all your hopes. Miſtake not Conviction for Converſion; make on, let not your God, nor your ſouls loſe the things which here been wrought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When there is ſome good thing done.</hi> When 'tis <hi>in facto eſſe.</hi> When the Rubbiſh is removed, and the firſt ſtone is laid; when the Plough hath been going, and the good Seed is ſown; when the New-creature hath paſſed the Birth; when Chriſt is formed, and the light of life is newly ſprung up in the ſoul; it there be but <hi>a grain of Muſtard-ſeed,</hi> the leaſt and the loweſt degree of ſaving Grace, broken forth in the heart, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not, whether it be much or little, if it be grace, there's the immortal ſeed, there's the good work begun, which ſhall be carried on till the day of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Grace is a ſecurity for Glory:</hi> Yet beware Chriſtians, let not this ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty make you ſecure; though there be an Harveſt in the ſeed, yet the ſeed muſt be cheriſhed, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and well looked to, that it may grow up to the Harveſt: He that lets it dye for want of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, proves that it was dead whileſt alive. Let not your falling ſhort of Glory, prove that your Grace was not Grace.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians lay hold on the Promiſe, and lift up
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47970:135"/>
your heads; you are under fears, however it be with you for the preſent, you are in doubt how it may be; your way is long, and dangerous; yet your hearts are deceitful and unſtable; you are going on at preſent, but doubt how you ſhall hold out: I may meet with Lions in the way, which may fright me back; I may loſe my way, and never recover: I may be weary, and faint in the way, and lye down and give off. My Lord and my ſoul, have been often upon the parting point; I have been almoſt gone, and I tremble to think what may yet become of me: Yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member who it is that hath ſaid, <hi>I will not turn from you to do you good, I will put my fear in your hearts, and you ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Riſe ſoul, take care for to day, and take no thought for to morrow. Mind the preſent duty, go on thy way, though weeping and trembling, and hard beſtead; go on thy way, and then commit thy way, and thy ſelf to him, by whoſe mighty Power thou ſhalt be kept through faith unto ſalvation. Faithful is he that hath called you, and will do it</p>
               <p>And now you have all. <hi>Let us hear the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the whole matter.</hi> God hath made a Covenant with his people, hath given <hi>himſelf</hi> for their Portion, <hi>his Son</hi> for their price, <hi>his Spirit</hi> for their guide in the way, <hi>his Earth</hi> for their accommodation by the way, <hi>his Angels</hi> for their Guard, <hi>the Powers of darkneſs and death</hi> for their Spoils, <hi>everlaſting Glory</hi> for their Crown. And becauſe their way is difficult, and their work is contrary to them, he hath given them all that grace that is neceſſary to bring them to Glory.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47970:135"/>
In General, <hi>a new heart,</hi> in all things ſuited to their way, and throughly furniſhed for every good work. In Particular, <hi>Knowledge</hi> to guide, <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to fix and intend, <hi>tenderneſs</hi> to ſubmit ro and yeeld, <hi>love</hi> to conſtrain and bring on, <hi>fear</hi> to fence and hold in, <hi>obedience</hi> to perform and bring forth, and <hi>perſeverance</hi> to go through, and hold out to the end; and there grace and glory meet. This is the Covenant of grace, this is the word, which by the Goſpel is preached unto you.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid, But if God hath undertaken all this for us, what is there then left on us to do? Here's a Doctrine according to ſinners hearts; if this be Goſpel, then ſoul take thine eaſe, take thy liberty, caſt away care, make much of thy body, God will take care of the reſt.</p>
               <p>But is there nothing required of us? Let the Scriptures ſpeak, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. <hi>Yet for all this will I be enquired of,</hi> or ſought unto <hi>by the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> otherwiſe let them look for no ſuch things. He that will not ask in faith, <hi>let not that man think he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord, Jam.</hi> 1.7. And can he think to receive any thing, that neither believes nor prayes? That neither prayes in faith, nor prays at all? <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12,13. <hi>It's God works in you, both to will and to do.</hi> What then? Therefore ſit you ſtill and do nothing? No ſuch matter; therefore work out your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with fear and trembling ſaith the Apoſtle. The promiſe of God was never intended, to make the command of God of none effect. God in promiſing grace, promiſes a power for duty; and as he doth not give, ſo we muſt not receive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat power or grace of God in vain. Whilſt he gives
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47970:136"/>
what he requires, he ſtill requires what he gives. That promiſe of God <hi>(ye ſhall be my people)</hi> though he undertake to make it good, yet it is alſo the matter of our ſtipulation. And in this promiſe wherein the Lord aſſures us, what <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto</hi> we (ſhall) be, is included a Precept, wherein we may underſtand what <hi>de jure</hi> we (ought) to be.</p>
               <p>In undertaking to give us a new heart, a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and obedient, a perſevering heart, the Lord doth promiſe, both to make us what we ſhould be, and to help us in what we are bound to do; and gives us at once a clear hint, both of our mercy and our duty. This is the ſence and ſumm of that Promiſe, The Lord will work all that in us, and will help and cauſe us to perform all that which (is required) unto ſalvation; and ſo the <hi>Promiſſum</hi> on Gods part, doth not make void, but eſtabliſh the <hi>Debitum</hi> on ours. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? Nay we eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though, it be certain as to the event, that all that's neceſſary to ſalvation, ſhall be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us, God hath undertaken that, yet it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as certain that God hath made our loving him, fearing him, obeying his whole will, and our ſincerity, and perſeverance herein, ſo neceſſary, that we cannot otherwiſe be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, miſtake not, nor abuſe the grace of the Goſpel. The Lord never meant your mercy ſhould make void your Obligation to duty. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from ſin, was never intended as a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſin. He gives not his Spirit, in favour of the fleſh. What he undetakes to work for
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47970:136"/>
you, was never with a mind to maintain you in idleneſs, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11,12. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation, teacheth us, that denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though you are <hi>ſaved by grace,</hi> yet you are ſtill (in a ſenſe) <hi>debtors to do the whole Law.</hi> Perfect Obedience to the whole Law, even to the utmoſt <hi>Iota,</hi> is ſtill due from you; and if it be not in your hearts, to pay all that you owe, that is, if there be any duty commanded, in the whole book of God, that you muſt be diſpenſed with, that you will not ſet your hearts to obſerve and obey; if there be any one ſin that you muſt be excuſed in, and will not part with; if there be any, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch of holy Care, Activity, Induſtry, Zeal for God and Holineſs, that you will not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to preſs hard after; this is an evidence of ſuch an unſound heart, as hath no part in the Goſpel, or the ſalvation thereof. Perfection is ſtill due, though ſincerity will be accepted. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity ſhall be accepted, but what is ſincerity leſs, then an hearty willingneſs to be perfect, atteſted by a ſtriving and preſſing on to that mark which is ſet before us.</p>
               <p>O admire and bleſs the Lord, the Lord for grace, but do not turn the grace of God into licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Shall we continue in ſin, becauſe grace that abounded? Will ye thus requite the Lord? Will ye thus deceive your ſelves, O fooliſh people and unwiſe? Will you ſlight him becauſe he hath loved you? Kick at him becauſe he hath cared for you? Shake off his Yoke, becauſe he hath ſecured you the Crown! Will you ſerve his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47970:137"/>
becauſe he hath ſaved you from them? Will you nouriſh your diſeaſes, becauſe he hath ſaid he will cure you? Will you live and not eat? Reap and not Plough? Will you not eat, becauſe he hath given you meat? Will you not run, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath given you Leggs? Nor work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath given you hands? Nor watch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath given you eyes? Or will you tempt the Lord, and call that your truſt in him? Awake from ſuch madneſs.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, ſay not (If God will I ſhall) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I take care or no, believe or no, repent or no, be obedient, or rebellious, whether I wake or ſleep, work or be idle; my unbelief, my diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, my negligence, ſhall not make the faith of God of none effect. But rather, ſince God hath ſaid, (you ſhall) let thine heart anſwer (I will) walk in his ſtatutes. Ariſe O my ſoul, up and be doing; work out thy ſalvation, becauſe its God that worketh in thee to will and to do: Shake off thy ſloth, ſet to thy work, run out thy race, ſince God hath ſaid, thou ſhalt not run, nor labour in vain. And look to it, for however thy Idleneſs, or greateſt Unfaithfulneſs, will not make void the Covenant of God, yet will it make manifeſt, that thou haſt no part nor lot in it.</p>
               <p>But to all theſe glorious things that have been ſpoken, poſſibly ſome will reply; O if all this be ſo, then happy Saints indeed; <hi>Happy are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are in ſuch a caſe, yea bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> But will the Lord indeed do all theſe things for Mortals? Will he take notice of Worms? Shall ſuch dry bones live? Will he ſet ſuch vile duſt as the Apple of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47970:137"/>
his eye? Is not this too good to be true? Too great to be believed? Are we not all this while but in a Dream, or a fools Paradiſe? Oh that I were ſure the one half were as it hath been told me. Too great to be believed? As if it muſt be queſtioned whether the Sun light, becauſe it dazles our eyes. But what certainty would you have? Is all this too great for the great and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to do, who hath ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.9. <hi>As the Heavens are higher then the Earth, ſo are my wayes higher then your wayes, and my thoughts, then your thoughts.</hi> Can he not do it, who can do all things? Will he not do it, when he hath ſaid he will? Will the Lord mock? Can God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? Shall his Word, yea and his Oath too, thoſe <hi>two immutable things, in which it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for God to lye,</hi> can theſe fail? If you ſhould hear the Lord himſelf ſpeaking to you from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with audible voice, My Covenant I make with thee, and it is my intent and purpoſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form every word that is written in it, according to the plain import and meaning thereof; there ſhall not a tittle fail, neither will I alter the thing that is gone forth of my lips. Heaven and Earth ſhall fail, but my word ſhall not fail; truſt to it, truſt everlaſting truth, truſt to everlaſting ſtrength.

I was a ſtranger, and he took me in, and made me an heir; and preferred me from the Dunghill to the Throne, and from a Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of wood, and Drawer of water, to attend his Court, and know his Counſels, and do his pleaſure. Happy am I that ever I was born to partake of this endleſs dignity.</p>

Will the Lord dwel on Earth? Or if he will, ſhal ſo foul a Stable, ſo unclean a Stye, as my heart hath been, ſhal this be the place that the Lord of life will take up his lodging, and keep his Court in? Will he indeed come with all his Train of Graces, and live, and walk in me? How can theſe things be? But he hath ſaid it, and I do, and I will believe it.</p>

                              <hi>I</hi> am going where you cannot come; where no unclean thing ſhal enter, nor any thing that defileth. Methinks <hi>I</hi> ſee all my Afflictions and Temptations, all mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:47970:173"/>
and corruptions falling off me, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi>'s Mantle at his tranſlation.</p>
                           <p>O my Soul, doſt thou not ſee the Chariots of fire, and the Horſes of fire come to take thee up? <note place="margin">Luk. 16.22.</note> Be thou as poor as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> yet God will not diſdain to ſend a Party of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to conduct thee home. How canſt thou doubt of ready reception, who haſt ſuch a friend in Court, who will lead thee with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into his Fathers preſence. <note place="margin">Gen. 45.16.</note> If there were Joy in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, when it was ſaid, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s Brethren are come; ſurely it will be welcom newes in Heaven, when its told, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> his Brethren are come.</p>
                           <p>My Soul, fear not to enter, though the Lord be clothed with Terrour and Majeſty: For thy Redeemer will procure thee favour, and plead thy right. <note place="margin">Joh. 16.27</note> I am ſure of welcom, for the Father himſelf loveth me.

Much more will he receive me gladly, and let out his loves upon me, when preſented to him by his Son, in his perfect likeneſs, as a fit Object for his everlaſting delight. Fear not, O my Soul, as if thou wert going to a ſtrange place. Why Heaven is thy Countrey, and thy home: wilt thou doubt of leave, or fear of welcome, when it is thine own home? Why, my Soul, thou waſt born from above, and here is thy Kindred, and thy Fathers Houſe, and therefore
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:47970:174"/>
thou ſhalt ſurely be admitted. And then ſhall I ſee the glorious preparations of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Love, and the bliſsful Manſions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inhabitants.</p>
                           <p>Doubtleſs it ſhal be thus. Theſe are not ſick-mens Dreams, or childrens hopes. The living God cannot deceive me: and may not I certainly promiſe my ſelf, what the Lord hath promiſed me? I will ſooner think that all my ſenſes are deluded, and what I ſee and feel, and taſte, is but a fancy, then think that the living God will deceive me, or that his unchangeable Covenant will fail. <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2.</note> Now I am a ſon of God, but it doth not yet appear what I ſhal be: but this I know, I ſhal be like him, and ſee him as he is.</p>
                           <p>I know it ſhal be thus. Why, what ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould <hi>I</hi> ask of God? He hath given me all the aſſurance in the world. And though the word of God be enough, yet he willing to ſhew more abundantly to the Heits of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the immutability of his Counſel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by an Oath: <note place="margin">Heb. 6.17.</note> that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, <hi>I</hi> might have ſtrong conſolation. O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Unbelief! What ſhal not the Oath of a God put an end to thy ſtrife?</p>
                           <p>O my God, I am ſatisfied: it is enough. Now I may be bold without preſumption, and boaſt without Pride. And will no more call my Duty Arrogance, nor my Faith a Fancy.</p>
                           <p>O my Soul! There is but a ſhort life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

                           </p>
                           <p>It is well Lord; thy word is enough. Thy Bond is as good, as ready payment. The holy Ghoſt tells me, that life and glory abide me; <note place="margin">Luk. 23.43.</note> that look what day I looſe from the body, the ſame day I ſhal be landed in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

                           <p>But this is not all. When my body hath ſlept a ſhort Nap in the duſt, Chriſt will call to it, Come up hither. Ah true Yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it will be hard parting, but welcome meeting. I could not leave thee, but to live with Chriſt. <note place="margin">Col. 3.4.</note> But he will raiſe thee a glorious Temple; and when he ſhal appear, will bring me with himſelf in glory; and then I ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter thee as a Royal Manſion, wherein I ſhal abide with the Lord for ever. For as we have ſerved our Redeemer together, ſo we muſt be glorified together with him. And when the Lord hath married us both together again, then will he marry us both unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For <hi>I</hi> know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhal ſtand at the laſt day over the Earth. And though after my skin, wormes deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh I ſhal ſee
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:47970:175"/>
God. Whom I ſhal ſee for my ſelf, and mine eyes ſhal behold, and not another, though my Reines be conſumed within me. My Lord hath already told me how it ſhall be. He hath ſet down the time, and ſhewed me the Robes of immortality, and the Crown of life, that I muſt put on; and the Throne of glory, and the Seat of judgement, that <hi>I</hi> muſt ſit in. He hath told me the manner in which I ſhal be preſented to him, and eſpouſed by him. He hath told me where he will ſet me, and what he will ſay to me, and how he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my mean ſervices, and remember what <hi>I</hi> have forgotten: <note place="margin">Mat 25.35,37.</note> how he will praiſe the works, that <hi>I</hi> have been aſhamed of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me openly, for what <hi>I</hi> have buried in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy; <note place="margin">Mat. 6.4.</note> and not forget the pooreſt Almes that <hi>I</hi> have given for his Name. Then will he confeſs me before his Father, and before the Angels of God. Thus ſaith the true, and faithful witneſs, and we know that his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is true.</p>

                           <p>Let not my Lord be angry, that thy duſt and aſhes ſpeaketh thus unto thee.

                           <p>O thou God of my hopes, I look for a new body, and a new ſoul, for new Heavens, and for a new Earth, according to thy promiſe; when my whole ſoul ſhall be wholly taken up with thee, and all mine affections ſtrained to the higheſt Peg, and all the Wheels of my raiſed powers ſet in moſt vigorous and perpetual motion towards thee, ſtill letting in, and ſtill laying out: and thus ſhall there be an everlaſting communication of joy and glory from thee, and of love and praiſe from me.</p>
                           <p>O my ſoul, thou art rich indeed, and increaſed in goods. Thou haſt no reaſon to envy the glory

My Robes ſhall never wear, my Crown ſhall never totter, my Throne ſhall never be vacant; My Bread ſhall never mold, my Garland ſhall never wither, my Houſe ſhall never moulder, my Wine ſhall never ſowre, but everlaſting joy ſhall be upon my head, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flie away.</p>
                           <p>O my God, how happy haſt thou made me! It is better then I could have wiſhed. Thou haſt done all things well. Thou haſt ſetled them for ever. The whole Earth cannot ſhew any ſuch he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage or Tenure. The world can ſtate out her poſſeſſions but for years, nor can ſhe make a good title for that neither. But mine Inheritance is for ever, and none can put me out of poſſeſſion. The thing is eſtabliſhed in Heaven; and in the Volume of the Book it is written of me. My evidence cannot be loſt. It is recorded in the Court above, and enrolled in the ſacred leaves of the Word, and entred upon the Book of my Conſcience, and herein I do, and will rejoyce.</p>
                           <p>Now my ſoul wipe up thine eyes, and go away with <hi>Hannah,</hi> and be no more ſad. What though mine Houſe be not ſo with God, ſo happy, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous as I could wiſh? What though they be encreaſed that trouble me, and my temptations and afflictions be like the rolling Billows, riding on one anothers backs for haſte. Yet ſhall my

ſoul be as a rock unmoved, and ſit down ſatisfied in the ſecurity and amplitude of my portion. For God hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure; and herein is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire.</p>
                           <p>And now what remaineth, O Lord, but that I ſhould ſpend the remainder of my daies in loving, praiſing, and admiring thee. But wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, or bow my ſelf to the moſt High God. What ſhall I give thee to expreſs my thankfulneſs, though not to requite thy boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Alas my poor little ſoul! Alas that thou art ſo little. How narrow are thy capacities! How diſproportionate are thy powers! Alas that my voice can reach to no higher a note! But ſhall I do nothing, becauſe I cannot do all?</p>
                           <p>Lord I reſign to thee. With the poor Widow, I caſt my two mites (my ſoul and body) into thy Treaſury. All my powers ſhall love and ſerve thee. All my members ſhall be weapons of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for thee. Here is my good will. Behold my ſubſtance is thy ſtock; mine intereſt is for thy ſervice. I lay all at thy feet: There thou haſt them, they are thine. My Children I enter as thy Servants. My poſſeſſions I reſign as thy right. I will call nothing mine, but thee. All mine are thine: I can ſay My Lord, and my God, and that is enough; I thankfully quit my claim to all things elſe. I will no more ſay, My Houſe is mine, or my Eſtate mine; I my ſelf am not mine own: Yet it is infinitely better for me to be thine, then if I were mine own. This is my happineſs, that I can ſay my own God, my own Father. And O
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:47970:177"/>
what a bleſſed exchange haſt thou made with me! to give me thy Self who art an infinite Sum, for my ſelf who am but an inſignificant Cypher.</p>
                           <p>And now Lord, do thou accept, and own my claim. I am not worthy of any thing of thine, much leſs of thee. But ſith I have a Deed to ſhew, I bring thy Word in my hand, and am bold to take poſſeſſion. Doſt thou not know this hand? wilt thou not own this name? wilt thou not confirm thine own grant? It were infidelity to doubt it. I will not diſparage the faithfulneſs of my Lord, nor be afraid to averre, and ſtand to what he hath ſaid and ſworn. Haſt thou ſaid, Thou art my God, and ſhall I fear thou art mine enemy? Haſt thou told me, Thou art my Father, and ſhall I ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof, as if I were a ſtranger? I will believe. Lord ſilence my fears; and as thou haſt given me the claim and title of a Child, ſo give me the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Child. Let my heart be daily kept alive by thy promiſes, and with this ſtaffe let me paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jordan.</hi> May theſe be my undivided compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and comforters: When I go, let them lead me; when I ſleep, let them keep me; when I awake, let them talk with me. And do thou keep theſe things for ever upon the imaginations of the thoughts of the hearts of thy people, and prepare their hearts unto thee. And let the heart of thy Servant be the Ark of thy Teſtament, wherein the ſacred records of what hath paſſed between thee and my ſoul, may for ever be preſerved. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>O Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord: Ye men of this world, ye ſpirits that are in Priſon, held captive to iniquity, under the Prince of this world; in a Covenant with Death, at an agreement with Hell; without Chriſt, Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtrangers from the Covenant of Promiſe, having no hope, without God in the world; who have ſaid, We will not have this man to rule over us; let us break his Bonds aſunder, and caſt his Cords from us; who are joyned to Idols, have choſen you other gods, are following after other Lovers: who walk after the courſe of this world, according to the Prince of the Power of the Ayr, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; having your converſation in the Luſts of the fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind, and being ſtill as you were by nature, the children of Wrath, in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity.</p>
               <p>O ye ſons of death, ye children of the night, and of darkneſs, Hear and your ſouls ſhal live; to you alſo is the word of this ſalvation ſent; even the ſtrangers, and thoſe that are afar off, that will lay hold on the Covenant, and chuſe the thing that pleaſeth God, theſe alſo ſhal have a name in his houſe, even the glorious name of Sons and Daughters.

               <p>Hearken O people, you that are polluted in your blood; written in the Earth,, free among the dead; come in, let your Covenant with death be made void, and your agreement with Hell be diſanulled, ſtrike a League with the Almighty, and your names alſo ſhal be written amongſt the living in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

After a few years of your vanity are over, where muſt your dwelling be? <hi>Who can dwell with the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire?

Whatever earth or hell can do againſt you, till they can tear the Covennnt of your God, or make you blot out your own names, they have left you abundantly enough, even when they have left you nothing.</p>

Preſent your ſelves to the Lord, as the accompliſhments of his Covenant, as the fruits of the death of your Redeemer, as the Trophies of his Victory, as the ſpoils which he hath recovered from Death and Hell, making a ſhew of them openly, that it may be ſeen that the promiſe of God is not of none effect, and that Chriſt did not die in vain. Let your Lord Jeſus when he comes down into his Garden where he left his blood, reap his pleaſant fruits, and carry up

your purified Souls as the ſignals of his glorious atchievement. Offer up <hi>your ſins</hi> to the Lord; theſe unclean beaſts will be an acceptable ſacrifice. There's more real honour growing up to the Lord, from one mortified Saint, then from ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Anthems from the moſt ſeraphick tongues. Offer up <hi>your duties</hi> to the Lord; your obedience for a ſacrifice. <hi>To obey is better then ſacrifice;</hi> then thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyle. Let your whole life be this ſacrifice: let every day be a Sabbath, every duty an Euchariſt, every member a Cymbal ſounding out the praiſes of God, Offer up <hi>the calves of your lips</hi> unto the Lord.

Oh whence is it, That the Mighty God ſhould indent, and come into bond with ſinful man! that he who was free from all men, ſhould make himſelf debtor to any! That the high and lofty One, that inhabits Eternity, ſhould dwell in Houſes of Clay, and pitch his Tabernacle in the Duſt! That he <hi>who humbleth himſelf to behold the Heavens,</hi> ſhould come down into the earth; and after what is he come down, but after a dead Dog or a Flea? that he ſhould make a league with the ſtones of the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

thee from darkneſs, reſcued thee as a brand out of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; that pitied thee in thy blood, waſhed thee from thy blood; ſpared thee, pardoned thee, reconciled thee, and brought thee, an enemy, a rebel, a traitor, into a Covenant of peace with the God of glory. Ah contemptible duſt! that ever there ſhould be ſuch compaſſionate contrivements, and ſuch aſtoniſhing condeſcentions of the eternal Deity, towards ſo vile a thing! O love the Lord all ye his Saints! O bleſs the Lord ye belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ye people near unto the Lord. Alas that our hearts ſhould be ſo narrow, that the waters ſhould be ſo ſhallow with us; where are our eyes, if we be not yet filled with wonders; what hearts have we, if we have not yet filled our lips with praiſe: Open all thy ſprings, O my ſoul, let them flow forth in ſtreams of love and joy; let every faculty be tuned and ſtrained to the height; let heart and hands, and tongue, and eyes lift up their voice; be aſtoniſhed O heavens, be moved ye ſtrong foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth, fall down ye Elders, ſtrike up ye heavenly Quires, lend poor mortals your Notes, to ſing forth the high praiſes of God, who rideth on the heavens, and hath cauſed us to ride on the high places of the earth, and made us ſit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hevenly places, ſhewing forth the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs to us in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Awake up my Glory, awake Pſaltery and Harps, I my ſelf wil awake right early. My ſoul doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour; for he that is mighty hath done for me great things, and holy is his Name. Bleſſed be the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who hath viſited and redeemed his People; who hath raiſed up an horn of ſalvation for us, in the houſe of his ſervant <hi>David;</hi> who hath laid help on one who is mighty, and exalted one choſen among the People, and hath given him for a Covenant to them. Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me bleſs his holy Name; who hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thy life from death, and crowned thee with loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tender mercies. Salvation to our God, that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb. Let the Redeemed of the Lord ſay ſo, Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and glory, and honour, and bleſſing; for thou livedſt, and waſt dead, and art alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Thou haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and haſt made us Kings and Prieſts unto our God for ever. <hi>Hallelujah, Hallelujah.</hi>
